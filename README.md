Challenges: I'm trying to get data that will be usable in the https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-race-explained bar chart. I'm running into a few errors. 

1) We may have too much data, but I don't really think that's it.
2) It's designed for dates to be the stamp, and year incriments, so this may need more manipulation or we need to bring in the dates found in an online csv but am having errors to work though still to pull correctly. Tried reading like you would a raw data set in github but may need a scrape

Additionally, I'd like the data to be cumulative not just episode by episode.
