I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done.", "I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?", "If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]", "Any messages?", "Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.", "It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.", "People say I am the best boss. They go, \"God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious.\" \"And you get the best out of us.\" [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.", "Whassup!", "Whassup!", "Whass...up!", "[Strains, grunts] What?", "OK. All right. See you later.", "Back to work.", "Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.", "Um... Me no get an agenda.", "I didn't get any agenda.", "Really? I didn't... [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning?", "Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?", "Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.", "Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.", "OK...", "No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.", "All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!", "OK. No problem.", "Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?", "Question. How long do we have to... [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?", "Oh, that's not appropriate.", "Uh, I don't know what you mean.", "Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.", "No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that.", "Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them.

This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. [Continues with cod German]", "Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]", "Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.", "I'm sorry?", "If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]", "I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.", "People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one.

I promise you that.", "No.", "Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.", "I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.", "Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.", "No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right?

This is Ryan, the new temp.", "Introduce yourself. Be polite.", "Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.", "That's his profit.", "OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?", "What is that?", "No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.", "Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.", "And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.", "[Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.", "Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.", "Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.", "So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?", "You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?", "Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...", "Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.", "Why? Well, theft and stealing.", "Post-it Notes.", "50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.", "Yeah. I am.", "But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.", "[Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.", "I don't know about that.", "What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, \"Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?\" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.", "Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?", "Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.", "Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it.

How are you doing, man?", "Did you have a good weekend going there?", "Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar---", "Right. See?

I wish every day was diversity day.", "Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!", "You know what? This is a color-free-zone here.

Right?", "You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.", "Yes.", "OK.", "Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.", "OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...", "Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.", "How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?", "I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.", "OK, I will play guy listening.", "OK.", "Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.", "OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... [As Chris Rock] Every time...

I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?", "Sure.", "Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.", "OK, well I know. You told me that several times.", "OK.", "Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.", "I won't.", "Yeah, yeah.", "\"I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness...\" Open-mindedness, is that even a word? \"...into the workplace.

He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.", "All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.", "Get out.", "No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive.

I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over.

Jim?", "Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.", "Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...", "Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste.

Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um...

I think that goes without saying.", "Oh, yeah right.", "Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you.

I know a lot of lawyer jokes.", "Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.", "When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.", "The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.", "Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.", "No, I've seen the video.", "No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]", "Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.", "Mmmhmm. Yes.", "THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!", "[laughing] Come on.", "Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office]", "You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.", "It's... That's...", "Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.", "I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.", "This guy does it all.", "What?", "So I'm not in trouble?", "I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.", "Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...", "I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.", "No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.", "Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.", "No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.", "I don't know about that.", "Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.", "Yes, your corner. Go.", "Mmmhmmm.", "They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on.", "Oooh!", "I'm not worried.", "You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.", "Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.", "I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.", "Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.", "Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. \"Home Alone,\" \"Risky Business.\" Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.", "Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.", "Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.", "Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.", "Maybe.", "Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.", "Sign the papers at the condo.", "Uh, I don't need one.", "I don't need a representative.", "No, No.", "No. Dwight. I'm fine.", "Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.", "Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.", "Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.", "As my associate.", "No it is not.", "Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.", "We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.", "Very good.", "We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?", "Good. The Small Business Man?", "Maxim? American Way? Cracked?", "How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?", "NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you.", "Ok. See you soon.", "I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?", "What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please...", "I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.", "I do not understand what you spend your money on.", "Home, sweet home.", "Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.", "Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.", "Nice to meet you too.", "Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.", "Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.", "This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.", "I'm putting my bed right over here.", "Well, then I will get a warrantee.", "Well then I won't get a warrantee.", "So that's the problem, is solved. What?", "Uh... Ten year.", "What? Wha? You said ten.", "Ok, ok, ok.", "Alright.", "Ok. Alright. Oh boy.", "Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?", "Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.", "Oh, man.", "Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees]", "The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't...", "...know if you showed me this same unit or not.", "Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.", "As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.", "There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.", "No, no, no.", "I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.", "Ehhhh....", "I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.", "There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.", "No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.", "Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.", "I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.", "What the hell is a terrarium?", "Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.", "We take separate cars.", "Why would we do that?", "No.", "EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.", "Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.", "Nobody likes beets.", "Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.", "Stop it! [smacks Dwight's arm]", "Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?", "Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.", "You know.", "Really?", "What's this?", "I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.", "Get up here, Dwight.", "Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem?", "Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that?", "Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.", "Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]", "Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?", "Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?", "That is ridiculous.", "Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.", "[speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is?", "Mmm... No. That was Yoda.", "There are ten rules of business that you need to learn. Number one[/b]: You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.", "And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.", "[to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like shooting a gun] Hey!", "Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.", "Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.", "Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two.", "So what was rule two?", "Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower.", "Okay, uh, well, one is taken.", "Well, he needs a permanent number, right?", "Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.", "Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?", "Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?", "Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for...", "...for Phone. What?", "Um, oh, thinking about business school?", "Really?", "So you think you know a lot about business?", "Uh huh.", "Yeah. Quiz me.", "Come on, egghead. Let's do it.", "Quiz me up.", "Uh...", "When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.", "[to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it's equal.", "Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.", "Okay, Dwight.", "You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.", "For instance, why don't you go to business...", "Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.", "I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all.", "Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?", "You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.", "I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?", "Nah, I'm okay.", "Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?", "Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here? Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?", "Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do?", "Well, I would definitely have s*x with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business.", "Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo...", "Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...", "What's that?", "Yeah.", "Dwight. Hey!", "Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.", "I didn't say it to him. I said it about him.", "[in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.", "Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find.", "I gave it to you in the car.", "I saw you program it in.", "Okay. Alright.", "Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir...", "Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.", "Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.", "Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?", "Toaster Oven 101?", "Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.", "[singing] ...since the world was turning.", "Okay. Rule five - safety first, i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.", "Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.", "I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.", "Happy Halloween, everyone! [notices Pam, in her cat costume] Oh... that's great!", "Ohh... OK.", "I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay.", "Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.", "Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.", "I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.", "Okay... Sherri?", "If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?", "Thanks.", "I'll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could fire Sherri.", "Okay! I'm sorry.", "No?", "Bye.", "I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.", "Yes.", "Yes.", "Yeeesh.", "Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.", "Because it's very scary stuff.", "You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.", "No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?", "And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.", "I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around]", "Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.", "Hey.", "You guys excited about the party?", "It's gonna be fun.", "[looks to Oscar] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.", "All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?", "Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?", "Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.", "Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.", "Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.", "\"Bend It Like Beckham.\"", "[laughs] Yeah. That would be perfect.", "Well, I don't really have two heads. So...", "Who do you think it should be?", "No, Jim brings in money.", "Eh.", "It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.", "[turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?", "You're right, I didn't even think of him.", "Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.", "Yeah... I could.", "I'm not saying that's what he said.", "[listening to his head] What?", "That is not a very nice thing to say about him.", "Are you kidding?", "I agree. He'd land on his feet.", "So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?", "Ahh, come on.", "I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]", "Oh, God.", "Fantastic!", "What?! That would've solved all my problems.", "Oh, you idiot.", "If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.", "Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?", "You can call. Can you call 'em?", "Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.", "[clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute?", "Help. Me.", "I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.", "Yes.", "I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.", "No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.", "Yes, that's a good idea.", "Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!", "I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!", "Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.", "I... this is Creed.", "I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]", "And I'm very angry, and I want...", "I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.", "Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just... yeah.", "Uh, hey... Creed?", "Could I talk to you for a second?", "You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.", "I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.", "No, you wanna leave.", "Why... why are you making this so hard?", "I think you're right.", "No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.", "Hmm?", "What old days? What are you talking about?", "It's right here on the desk, yeah.", "I can't, I can't...", "I can't change anything. This is the way...", "I don't... okay, just listen.", "Don't...", "Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?", "I have to fire someone today, okay?", "Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.", "Don't...", "Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?", "Well, he...", "Well, maybe I did.", "Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.", "No.", "No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...", "I just hope that you and I can remain friends.", "Devon, wait, please.", "Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.", "I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.", "He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.", "You look great! And you're a princess?", "A fairy princess. You're very... .", "You're a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.", "[singing and tapping on his coffee mug] I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.", "Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.", "[to Pam] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.", "Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.", "Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?", "Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.", "Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. \"Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority.\" Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.", "Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?", "[in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.", "This is Tito.", "Calling from... [Ryan hangs up]", "[Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan's attention] Pick up.", "[in a high pitched voice] This is Mike Tyson.", "And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.", "Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.", "Because I would kick his ass.", "So? I've beaten up black belts.", "They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.", "And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.", "You were a Jet?", "Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.", "I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.", "Just hit me. You'll see.", "Oh, queer... [realizes he is on camera] eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.", "Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.", "Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...", "... he cried at the end of it. He did.", "Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?", "Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.", "Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!", "Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you.", "[Pam knocks on his door] Go away.", "I haven't signed them, ok?", "Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.", "Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.", "Oh, so that's what they are saying?", "Ok, alright, where is Dwight?", "Ok.", "Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.", "No, Really?", "Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.", "Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches[/b]: me punching you and you hitting the floor.", "Really?", "You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.", "No, they must have class.", "Look...", "Hey, Toby.", "I've got an idea[/b]: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.", "I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.", "I think it is. A guy told me about that.", "Oh.", "Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.", "Hey!", "What the hell was that?", "No.", "Alright, that's the way you want it.", "Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.", "I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.", "I got his pants.", "Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot!

Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to hit Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie]", "Open your mouth.", "You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? \"Raging Bull.\" Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. [Michael opens his blinds and looks at Ryan in the parking lot] There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. [Calls Ryan on the phone, Ryan doesn't pick up after seeing that Michael is calling] Oh, we're playing phone tag.", "My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?", "[knock at the door] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?", "He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.", "[Knock at the door] Yeah.", "Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?", "If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.", "Alright, bye.", "Dwight?", "This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?", "Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time.", "Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.", "I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.", "I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?", "And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.", "I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.", "No, no, title change only.", "No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.", "Absolutely but not really.", "Yes you do.", "And, ditto.", "I told Dwight that there is honor in losing.

Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?", "Okay!", "Hello, everyone.", "Ah! Ha ha ha!", "Yeah?", "Stanley! Bo banley.", "Banana fana fo fanley.", "Be my mo manley.", "Stanley.", "Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?", "Maybe, I don't know.", "Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.", "It's cheaper.", "This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.", "It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!", "No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.", "Well, this...", "Yeah?", "To throw you off the scent.", "Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.", "Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, \"Who is this smart little cookie?\" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.", "I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.", "Leader... ship. The word \"ship\" is hidden inside the word \"leadership,\" as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!", "Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?", "Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.", "All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!", "Titanic?", "No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!", "No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.", "The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.", "[singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.", "Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring...

Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.", "Okay.", "In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.", "Hey, look! I'm king of the world!", "And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!", "Okay! So...", "Right.", "But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.", "I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...", "Rock it!", "If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!", "Yep.", "We're all gonna have a good time tonight!", "Hm? Okay. Yep.", "Having fun?", "Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.", "Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.", "So, okay.", "But before that, I have to do my presentation.", "All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!", "Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.", "Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?", "No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.", "Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.", "Okay.", "Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.", "I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?", "Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!", "Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!", "Then I'll give you away!", "Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.", "Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...", "It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.", "I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.", "Is somebody there?", "Captain Jack has a problem with authority.", "He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.", "Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.", "Roy said the first one didn't count.", "Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...", "Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.", "Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.", "BFD. Engaged ain't married.", "Never, ever, ever give up.", "It's a fake wheel, dummy.", "Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.", "I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God!", "Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!", "No, I want you to pick me up.", "I am hurt. I hurt my foot.", "I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up.

I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.", "Pam, could you come get me?!", "Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?", "There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that?", "I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.", "[panicked] No one wants to pick me up!?", "I'm not sick! I'm burned!", "Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.", "I don't want Dwight!", "I don't have a girlfriend.", "It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight.", "Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!", "Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.", "Did you explain why?", "Burned my foot, Pam.", "Please stop popping my cast. Thank you.", "Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping...", "Thank you. Pam, messages please?", "Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...", "No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God!", "What?", "I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.", "No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.", "What? Part of your duties are to what?", "You just said \"part of your duties are to\" something.", "Yes, you did. What is wrong with you?", "Where is my cornbread?", "Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like?", "Where are the yams?", "Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?", "And they had no yams?", "How strange. Because they always have yams.", "Pam... PAAAM!?", "Come here please.", "I want you to rub butter on my foot.", "Pam, please? I have Country Crock.", "Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!", "No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?", "[loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!", "I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.", "Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam.", "Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel.", "No, he's not.", "I just saw him.", "Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God!", "Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar?", "No, never heard of it. No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble.", "Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.", "Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?!", "Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.", "[sigh] I burned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!", "While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.", "Good question. Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big][/b]: AIDS.", "I don't think so, no.", "He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works.

You are so brave.", "But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.", "Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?", "Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.", "How did you get in your wheelchair?", "Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.", "Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.", "Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?", "Ok...", "Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I.

I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.", "[popping his bubble wrap cast] Hey!", "You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan.", "Did you get the yams?", "[sigh] Ok, I'll just have the pudding.", "Yeh.", "You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.", "Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.", "Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.", "Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.", "Why don't you go with him?", "I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.", "Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive.", "We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.", "Shotgun!", "The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout \"shotgun\" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played.

Cheese.", "I know, just sayin'.", "Dwight, what are you drinking?", "Give it to me.", "Dwight... [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road.

Gimme the bottle!", "Dwight, what is your middle name.", "[sigh] Something with a \"K\".", "What do I write under \"reason for visit\"?", "Nothing. I wrote \"bringing someone to the hospital\".", "No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]", "Hi Dwight.", "Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?", "Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.", "Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?", "Ok, what kinda machine is that?", "That's my joke, damnit Dwight.", "It's ok, they're with me.", "Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.", "Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.

I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend.", "He sounded sick.", "That's exactly what I was thinking.", "Yeah. Drop what you're doing.

Soda.", "Not so much.", "Nothing.", "Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.", "Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.", "Ok.", "Good.", "Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch?", "Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.", "Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.", "I know just he place.", "[at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?", "Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.", "Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi.", "We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.", "I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well.

Yeah!", "Thank you very much.", "Hilarious. Hey.", "Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.", "Just do it.", "[Michael messes up hair to look like Jim's] Expenses.", "No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?", "Yeah, it's a business lunch.", "No he did not. I don't need his permission.", "Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?", "I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.", "Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related?", "You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please?", "You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.", "I know, I know, I know.", "I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.", "Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.", "Yeah I'm good.", "Yeah I'm fine.

That's it. I'm out.", "People are always coming to me. \"Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust.\" No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble.

She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.", "Spamster!", "Hamster.", "Welcome back! How was your vacation?", "Yeah?", "Did you get lucky? Oh! Boink!", "I am Pam. Spicoli guy. Oh, God.

What is... what is that?", "Is it a bird?", "Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet.", "Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.", "Check it out.", "Check it out. Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee.", "What is it?", "What is it? No, just tell me what it is.", "I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.", "How do you know that? What is it, then?", "[as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes. All cleaned?

I used to sit right here.", "Yeah.", "Ed Truck. [exclaiming is disgust] Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, \"Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work.\" What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.", "You know who used to sit at that desk?", "Mm-mm. Todd Packer.", "Yeah.", "He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes.", "When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office [picture behind Michael falls]. Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that they were crazy.", "I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.", "Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. [laughs] Okay.", "Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired.", "Charley horse!", "Charley horse!", "Oh, okay. Gah.", "Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. [giggles] It was hysterical.", "[whispering] Dwight.", "Let's send up Accounting.", "Old fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah. Follow my lead.", "Hey guys.", "Ahem. What's up?", "Yeah! Oh ho ho [laughing]", "No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that.", "Watch out, Pam. You're next!", "Maybe!", "Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her.", "You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.", "Stop.", "Stop it. [Dwight hangs up] Stop. It. [Dwight beings to dial] Don't. Don't.", "All right.", "Hi, guys.", "I'm just walking around.", "Well, yeah.", "Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?", "[counting cash] Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... [moves money after seeing workmen walk by] ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.

Oh, what is that? That's my sale! [humming then dancing victoriously]", "[stops dance] Nothing.", "No. Just ...", "You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just...", "Yeah, paper business. Is this done?", "Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.

We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.", "You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.", "I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.", "Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done . [no one comes forward] Very well. Then you are all punished.", "You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. [phone rings, Phyllis reaches to answer] No. NO!

Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you?", "[meeting Ed Truck in parking lot] Ed? Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Must be kinda neat comin' back.", "Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.", "Oh, no, no, no. You're good. It was clerical. You're good. Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.", "I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.", "Really?", "Well, that figures. So how did you deal with people not liking you?", "Well... s-sure I can.", "Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father.", "Well, okay.

And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent?

I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].", "What?", "[grinning] Ohhh, God.", "Ohhh, no.", "Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.", "Okay.", "Thank you.", "Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.", "Get in here... everybody.", "Birthday party subs! My gift to you.", "The best.", "Yes.", "Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.", "Just the bread, it's fresh baked.", "Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.", "When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So... That was the worst birthday I think I ever had.", "Kevin? Respect the birthday please.", "Are you done? ...Good. Okay.", "Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles]", "... I asked for trick candles.", "Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.", "... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].", "There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.", "Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.", "And laughter... also.", "Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.", "[mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.", "Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.", "Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.", "How dare you sir. You are gross.", "[sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.", "No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!", "Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.", "Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.", "Kevin. You heard anything yet?", "Okay. Well. Live strong.", "Alright.", "Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...", "Oh, these... all your kids?", "Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?", "Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!", "Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me.", "Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].", "Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.", "Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!", "Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.", "Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.", "Yeah.", "Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.", "Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.", "[fake coughing] Narc!", "I wasn't attempting to compliment you.", "Uuf, well...", "[shakes head] Okay...", "Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!", "Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?", "Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin?", "Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?", "Waa... what? What are you talking about?", "Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.", "Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.", "I can do that, it is my office.", "Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.", "It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.", "No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, \"Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.\"", "I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.", "Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.", "Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?", "Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?", "Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?", "Yes it is.", "Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.", "I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.", "Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam.", "Really? [Jim shakes his head no]", "Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths \"I can't\" and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.", "The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.", "Yes, I will not be.", "Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.", "So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.", "Just forget it. Just the urine.", "Just. I need your urine.", "Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.", "It's none of your business.", "Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.", "I need clean urine for the lady.", "Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes", "A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.", "No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.", "Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.", "What's wrong? Where's your costume?", "Why? Wha...", "Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.", "Yes, sir.", "So you wanna? Thanks.", "Okay.", "Good.", "No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes]", "Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.", "Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.", "That's a nice tie.", "That is... who makes that?", "Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?", "[walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?", "What's the problem?", "So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?", "Yes.", "Yeah?", "Okay.", "What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...", "Okay... what?", "Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?", "[holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.", "No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.", "Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?", "Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.", "[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using \"I\" emotion language and no judging or \"you\" statements.", "Come on, seriously, that?", "Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.", "Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.", "Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.", "Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.", "[claps his hands twice] It is done!", "Yes.", "Are those all the other complains?", "I would like to see those please.", "You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.", "Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?", "Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?", "[looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.", "You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.", "How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble \"merely listen to and forgotten...\" ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?", "That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does \"redacted\" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked \"redacted\"... ?", "Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.", "All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.", "Uh... [reading]\"Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?\" [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?", "Here is a Kelly complaint: \"Ryan never returns my calls.\" Ugh, join the club.", "[crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?", "What?!", "Stanley. [off camera]", "[still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.", "Someone complained that the men's room is \"whites only\". Stanley, you know that's not true.", "Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.", "And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.", "Oh... ok.", "Okay, well... all settled, then.", "OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?", "All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution: Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.", "Uh. Dwight.", "Okay! Calm down.", "Hey, hey!", "Stop.", "Okay...", "Dwight...", "Stop...", "Oh... kay...", "Okay.", "Yes.", "Mm-hmm.", "[picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?", "Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!", "Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.", "Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] \"Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.\" [flips to another paper] \"Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.\"", "[reading] \"This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.\" [flips to another paper] \"Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.\" Gah. \"This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.\"", "[reading] \"Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.\"", "\"By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.\"", "The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.", "Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.", "Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.", "Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?", "Good. Okay.", "Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?", "Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?", "It'll take like two seconds.", "Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.", "Come on, everybody.", "We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.", "Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.", "What?", "[off camera] You just press the button.", "[off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.", "[off camera] That's terrible.", "[off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]", "It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.", "[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?", "But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.", "And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.", "Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, \"Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.\" Makes you feel good.", "I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.", "Top 80 percent!", "Yeah?", "Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!", "Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.", "I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.", "Oh, come on. Come on.", "You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.", "Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.", "Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.", "Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.", "Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.", "So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.", "Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.", "Well, then, they need our money more than ever.", "Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...", "Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.", "No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.", "What?", "That's a dog.", "That's a shawl.", "No. Humans with AIDS.", "Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.", "There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. \"I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.\" [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.", "I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?", "It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.", "Well, actually, it's my warehouse.", "Why are you here?", "Not. I said, not that.", "That's ironic.", "That you are afraid.", "Dinkin' flicka.", "Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture]", "[phone rings] Yes", "Who?", "Do I know a Carol Stills?", "Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it real good?", "Hi, Carol. How you doing?", "Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.", "Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.", "Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.", "Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.", "Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...", "Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?", "Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?", "Hey, Jan. How you doing?", "I am?", "Oh, okay.", "AIDS.", "Okay, sounds great.", "Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...", "Right.", "Yeah?", "What?", "Okay.", "Problem. Good.", "Good, All right. Sounds great.", "Bye.", "Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.", "Hey, hey.", "Hey, Carol.", "You look great.", "Oh, well... Kiss.

I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.", "Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends.

Just take it back.", "Okay, all right, whatever.", "You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves]", "Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning.

Oh, my God.", "Jan.", "Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.", "After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.", "Um...", "Hey. What...", "All right!", "Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go!", "Yeah!", "So close. So close.", "Hey, okay.", "Thank you.", "Okay. Thanks for coming.", "Okay. Talk to you Monday.", "Good night. She's a good boss.", "Oh, she's great.", "Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls.

I used to say, \"Don't go there,\" but that is so lame now. Or, \"You go, girl.\" Or... Um, when did \"Where's the beef?\" That was, like, a long, long time ago. It's funny how the shelf life of these things, like how long they last, like, \"Too much information\" probably came on the scene... I mean, I didn't hear it till, like, this month, so it's pretty recently.

Why...", "I mean, you just come in and you're just negative...", "...and you just walk negatively.", "Do you want me to find out what it says?", "Yes.", "What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about?", "Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me.

What do you want me to do about it?", "[sighing] It was unanimous, Toby.", "Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn't even about what Ryan thinks.

Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, \"Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason.\" I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys.

Cheer me up.", "So did you hear the news?", "Yeah.", "Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's... pssssh... . He was almost 70. Circle of life.", "[holds out arms to Pam]", "Yeah. Mmmmmm.", "Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'.", "The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that.", "What?", "Oh my God.", "That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.", "[clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...", "What are you doing?", "I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.", "I don't understand.

That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.", "[thoughtfully] A statue.", "Yeah.", "Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.", "We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...", "I think that is a great way to honor Ed.", "Life-size.", "Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.", "Mm hm.", "Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.", "But Ed truck can't because he is---", "DEAD.", "That's perfect.", "Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam.", "What?", "Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head!", "Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here.

And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.", "Okay, fine. Hurry back.", "[as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start. Um...", "Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?", "Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.", "[returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go.", "Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.", "Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay.", "Do you want to talk about it anymore?", "Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's. [upset] Do you think that this is a game?", "All right, we're starting over.", "You are not leaving. No! We are not done.", "Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. [breaking down]", "How do you know?", "That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?", "Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]", "[seeing bird] Oh, God!", "Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ...", "Oh shhhh--oot!", "No, he's not.", "No, he's not. [cradling bird next to face]", "Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!", "We don't know if it's dead.", "Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.", "Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it.", "No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.", "It's okay. It's okay. [pats Kelly on shoulder] Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.", "What are... What are you doing?", "No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?", "Glad you could all make it.", "Dwight, do you have the box?", "You made this? Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice.", "Yes.", "Shhh.", "Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.", "Uhhh... nothing.", "Yeah, nothing. How was your day?", "Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?", "I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had s*x. Is that what you want to hear?", "Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.", "Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.", "Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.", "[looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on.", "Uh huh.", "[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?", "No, I think you're cutting in line.", "No, I'm not going to settle down.", "Get in the back please.", "Boooooo. Thank you. [hi-five's Stanley]. That's right.", "No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.", "I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.", "Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.", "Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.", "Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.", "Thank God.", "Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?", "All right! Thank you!", "Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?", "Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...", "Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.", "And I will be taking questions.", "Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!", "Hey, what time is it?", "AM or PM?", "Oh, good.", "Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.", "Yes. Right. Good.", "Goodnight!", "Nice dress, Ryan.", "[laughing] OK.", "Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.", "How come you didn't get me one?", "Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.", "It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.", "Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.", "I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.", "Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.", "Kelly?", "Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.", "All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.", "Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '", "Okay. Spoiler... alert.", "Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What's the... oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from?", "And another thing about the Indian people... they love s*x positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?", "Thank you, Kevin.", "Well, I find it beautiful.", "No...", "No, You're not going to collect them.", "No. This is delightful, charming culture.", "My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just s*x. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.", "[points at woman] What does that look like to you?", "No one's even going to notice.", "Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.", "I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions...", "Oh, yuck. [spits out food]", "No. These s'mores are disgusting.", "Do you think they have any s'mores?", "All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?", "Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?", "Wow.", "Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!", "She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!", "I'm going to be. [to DJ] Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec. [speaks in microphone] Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.", "What do you say?", "I didn't hear you. [laughs]", "[lowers microphone] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.", "No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...", "Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.", "Yes.", "Ok. Okay. Good night. [louder] Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra.", "All right. Good night.", "Oh, God! [chokes on food] Oh. Wow.", "That's so spicy.", "Oh. You waiting for a call?", "Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.", "I was in that marriage arena, though.", "Yeah. Uuuuh... well.", "We're so alike. So alike. [leans in to kiss her]", "What are you doing?", "I'm... what? I didn't", "[scoffing noises] Can I have a ride home?", "These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.", "Sorry.", "This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. [sings] Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!", "There she is - Jan Levinson. First...", "...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.", "[singing] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.", "Yes.", "I don't understand.", "On whom's authority?", "What?", "You're welcome.", "Am I a small number person or a severance package person?", "Oh... [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.", "Well...", "Oh, you gotta be... Josh?", "Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?", "It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.", "Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.", "Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.", "Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.", "Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.", "Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...", "Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.", "What?", "Do I have any messages?", "Ok, ok...", "[facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.", "You knew about this all along, didn't you?", "Traitor. You are a traitor.", "I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.", "Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs]", "I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.", "So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...", "Awesome.", "This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.", "All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at Dwight] Let's go.", "Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.", "Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.", "No... way.", "No. There's no one else.", "Okay, okay. Um...", "Why?", "You sent him cards? You never met him.", "Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like \"Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.\" It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.", "I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.", "All right.", "Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.", "[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.", "Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?", "Don't touch me this time.", "Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?", "[takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie]", "The office.", "No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.", "Anything?", "What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?", "[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.", "That was hilarious. The foam ...", "Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.", "Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.", "God, Dwight!", "What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.", "Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!", "What?!", "We did it? We did it.", "Right here! Right here!

[In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.", "Okay.", "My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size.

Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.", "Welcome.", "Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.", "Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?", "Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!", "A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.", "Oh.", "They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.", "You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.", "[to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.", "[to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.", "Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is...", "Right.", "[talking to himself] I present the orientation video.", "Not now.", "I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.", "It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.", "I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?", "Work it out amongst your selves!", "Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?", "Will you?", "Please?", "Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!", "Yoko shack.", "Nope, no. Guests only.", "Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.", "Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.", "No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.", "Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.", "Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton.

A squid's eye or...", "How did you...", "People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.", "I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay.

Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.", "No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.", "The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people.

Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.", "Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!", "Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.", "Yeah.", "Go home, Toby. Just...", "Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] \"You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!\"", "No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...", "THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!", "See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change.

Stop it right-stop it right now.", "Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice.

May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person.

This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. [turns around, takes bandanna off] So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?", "Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]", "No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom.

I want you to think about it long and hard.", "Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.", "Good luck.", "Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.", "Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...", "I said 'was'.", "What does that even mean? That is impossible.", "But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition.

We need more attitude like that around the office.", "Yeah, do you?", "What did I say?", "Huh.", "Oh, no.", "No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.", "No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me.

Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.", "Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.", "Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady?

Have any of you talked to Dwight?", "Really?", "Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.", "Nice to have Oscar back.", "Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.", "Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?", "Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.", "Um.", "No. I don't want to do any of that.", "No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.", "Hey.", "What's up?", "Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.", "Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.", "How's this place treating you?", "Oh, well.", "No. I'm sure.", "So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.", "We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right.", "Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!", "Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh?", "Guilty.", "Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.", "So does this remind you of your childhood right now?", "Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.", "And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he's handing it to him]", "It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.", "Hello son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a road---", "How, would you stop interrupting please?", "Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.

Three-", "Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding. [Applause] So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.

Who's a fan of buff naked? Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.", "Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?", "He's in his knickers.

I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.", "How you doin'? You excited.", "Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?", "You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...", "Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?", "Here, let me...", "Just cover up that bald patch.", "Okay.", "You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.", "[in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!", "Long story short: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.", "This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.", "[whispers to father] That's ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking]", "This is bull****!", "Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.", "I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!", "Oh, shiii...", "Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!", "Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.", "Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.", "Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?", "I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.", "I will take care of that.", "I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.", "Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines \"wedding\" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride \"Mawige...", "The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.", "Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance...", "is a guy that...", "he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.", "No. I'm not going to...", "Ok. All right.", "Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!", "Come... Come on!", "Dwight, just...", "Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.", "OK.", "[sings] ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.", "I just want Phyllis to have a great day.", "We are great together. We are a great team.", "Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.", "Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.", "Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.", "Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.", "You're... You're welcome.", "They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.", "Be careful. Oh no!! [Phyllis and Bob smear cake on each other's face] Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me! [Michael smears cake on his own face]", "Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?", "Huh?", "Pop quiz.", "Why is today a special day?", "Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...", "In business school, Kevin. Business school.", "A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.", "Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?", "Will they throw their hats, you think?", "A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.", "Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: \"May your hats fly as high as your dreams.\" ... That was a pretty good line.", "I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!", "We have fun.", "Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!", "Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.", "I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.", "Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.", "So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?", "Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.", "...And products!", "Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.", "We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]", "...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.", "...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.", "Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?", "Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?", "...Wait, Ryan said that?", "Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.", "David will always beat Goliath.", "Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, s*x predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?", "Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!", "Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.", "You heard me, pack your things.", "Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.", "A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.", "Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.", "Wow! You did these... freehand?", "My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much?", "I don't see a... price.", "Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?", "That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.", "What?", "...Chunky. Do you want half?", "Okay.", "It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.", "Can you confirm that the straps are tight?", "And now, the chains.", "A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.", "MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can.", "No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!", "I will get out. Oh yes, I will.", "No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]", "AHHHH!", "Yes.", "I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...", "Alright.", "Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.", "Pam, would you smell my breath?", "\"Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?\" Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company.

Might be a good idea.", "Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.", "Play some games?", "I spy?", "Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going?

Thank you sir!", "Thank you.", "Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.", "I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.", "Yes.", "Ok.", "Hi.", "Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.", "Oh, um, potato salad.", "No, it's not.", "Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.", "It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.", "What are you looking for? You bring dip?", "Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.", "Over our love.", "You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.", "It's a heart.", "I love this woman!", "Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...", "Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.", "Ok.", "It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.", "Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?", "I could go for an appeteaser.", "Bagel bites or something.", "Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.", "David, how much did this house cost?", "Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently]", "Yeah. Do you have any ice?", "How about some Splenda?", "This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.", "You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.", "Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.", "Crazy.", "Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?", "What are you doing?", "Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.", "What has gotten into you?", "No, no, no.", "Come on, let's go back to the party.", "Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.", "No, no, no, means please don't. Please.", "I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.", "You're acting inappropriate. Jan.", "Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.", "Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...", "You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?", "Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.", "I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.", "I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.", "Whatever.", "That's all, you didn't mean it?", "I love you, Jan.", "No need for consternation, everything is under control.", "It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.", "No...", "No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.", "Yeppers.", "I don't... remember.", "Yeesh...", "Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.", "Wikipedia.", "Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.

I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should...

Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off.", "Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.", "[long pause] I am declining to speak first.", "Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.", "What?", "No, this is a power suit.", "[Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.", "Ohh... kay.", "All right.", "Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?", "No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin.", "There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual.", "Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.", "Okay.", "Would you stop it, please?", "It's European, OK? It's a European cut.", "No, they don't. See? [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]", "Italians don't wear pockets.", "No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.", "Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.", "Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes.", "Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.", "[mumbles jibberish]", "[mumbling softly] That was a very good point.", "[mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.", "I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.", "Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.", "Oh. [scoffs] Come on. Be serious.", "I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.", "I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.", "Plus perks, yes.", "Fourteen years.", "No, please, please...", "Ok, let's take 15, again.", "A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.", "Oh, thank you.", "I didn't give you $40.", "Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia.", "I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.", "Well what am I supposed to do?", "I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous.", "[exhales] That's true.", "You know what? I should.", "I have been a loyal employee for a long time.", "You know what? I deserve a bump.", "I am makin' it happen, sergeant.", "No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today.", "Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away.", "Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.", "Mm-hm.", "Hey, I'd rather kill myself.", "[talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.", "[sighs] Fine.", "Toby, come on. Let's go.", "Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go.", "Yeah. Fine.", "[imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker. Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way.", "Well...", "Mm, the Big Apple.", "Maybe I'll stay.", "Well...", "[mouth full of pretzels] Oh, I...", "Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.", "All right.", "Who's the boy toy?", "Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?", "Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.", "Pippity poppity.", "Six percent? After all we've been through?", "I got you... jade earrings.", "No!", "No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more s*x.

You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere.", "Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---", "Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---", "Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise.", "But you just said 15.", "Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more... than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having s*x with Jan--", "Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.", "Hmm.", "I can, and I have.", "Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift. [points] Pudge has driven the forklift.", "I thought your name was Pudge?", "Okay. Um, her.", "Ah, fine.", "Yeeesh.", "[barely keeping his composure] \"Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!\" [laughs]", "Bail'er? I hardly know her.", "Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...", "It's a big red trash compactor!", "Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions...", "...would I go near---", "Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go!", "Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and...", "Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour?", "Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?", "Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. [to warehouse guys] Sorry, he is very lame.

He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, \"Hey! You ever seen a suicide?\" And I jump. And they freak out.

The press wants a story, I will give them a story.", "Here is your headline. \"Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client. Some companies still know how business is done.\" Okay? Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go!", "OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.", "Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.", "And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.", "So, let us consider this matter ended.", "I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry.", "Well, we are extremely sorry.", "We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.", "The watermark... it's a one time thing.", "OK...", "What... can I do, for you?", "Well... [exhales] OK, well... Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill---", "The guys at the papermill--- No no no!", "I'm the head of the company?!", "No, I'm a regional manager---", "No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out!", "That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.", "Doesn't matter. Out please!", "Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?", "We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not...", "No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...", "You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two. [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?", "[Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael's hair] OK, I think that's good.", "\"Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.\"", "That's how devoted I am to this job.", "I know.", "I understand that, Dwight.", "Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?", "So I'll know where---", "I'm asking Pam to do it, please.", "OK, ready?", "Five, four, three. \"There is no way, I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day.\"", "That's... they always give an ultimatum.", "Good, cut?", "Thought so too.", "What's happening?", "Really? Is she OK?", "OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]", "Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?", "[laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.", "Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]", "What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down]", "Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs]", "Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.", "Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.", "Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your pen1s. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.", "In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.", "Huh?", "I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -", "Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.", "I... uh, well, I don't know.", "[exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.", "OK.", "This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.", "Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]", "Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.", "OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.", "See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?", "No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.", "Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?", "That is not current.", "You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.", "I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.", "Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.", "OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a pen1s, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.", "What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.", "Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.", "No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.", "Yes.", "Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.", "I have to know whether you're serious or not.", "Ye - OK, yes.", "You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]", "OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!", "[Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping]", "Many women are competent drivers. [scraping] OK. Come on.", "All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.", "You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.", "Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it \"shmear?\" Like the cream cheese.", "What, um... what do you think of role-play?", "Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.", "I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.", "Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during s*x.", "[groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.", "No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.", "No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.", "No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]", "OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.", "Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts[/b]: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.", "She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.", "I'm unhappy when I'm with her.", "I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having s*x.", "Yeah, that's smart.", "That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.", "I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.", "Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.", "Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.", "Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.", "Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.", "Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply] It's Jan. What do I do?", "OK, it stopped.", "Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...", "Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]", "Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?", "Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.", "OK, I am really going to do this.", "You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs]", "I love you guys. Now I'm getting her voicemail.", "[leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.", "Thank you.", "Abso-fruit-ly.", "No... No...", "Yeah.", "Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] \"... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -\" [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] \"who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.\"", "[sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. \"Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?\" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.", "Ughh... Blech.", "Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...", "Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.]", "Maybe.", "Not it. I don't have eggs.", "That's possible.", "Uh-huh?", "The CFO? Ohh...", "OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.", "To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?", "And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?", "Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...", "...you just gots to get your freak on.", "Yeah.", "Hmmm.", "Really?", "Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.", "May God guide you in your quest.", "OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.

Somebody has to stay here.", "I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.", "Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you", "We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.", "What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.", "I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?", "This way to the partay bus.", "Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.", "If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.", "Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!", "Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.", "Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down?", "Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...", "Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.", "Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!", "Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.", "Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.", "Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.", "Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.", "I'm not playing.", "Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.", "We are going to choose team names. Dwight?", "Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?", "Then I will name your team the Red team.", "I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.", "Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.", "Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.", "It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.", "Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!

[holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.", "Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes?", "Thanks a bunch.", "A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.", "OK, who's hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.", "No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?", "Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!", "No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.", "Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.", "I can't say.", "The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.", "The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?", "I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.", "[points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let's see it.", "Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!", "13 hot dogs, everybody!", "It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.", "Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go.", "Aaaaaand, go!", "Nice, Stanley!", "One. Two. Three.", "Excellent!", "I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?", "Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.", "Please just check.", "What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.", "Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!", "Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.", "No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.", "Pointless.", "Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.", "Ji.. why not? C'mon.", "You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.", "Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.", "Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.", "Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay.", "Yes. Count to three, please.", "Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.", "Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?", "Okay.", "Don't, don't.", "I'm not going to give it to you.", "Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. \"Outside Hire.\"", "Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.", "God! He's a comedian.", "Who's Amanda Bynes?", "Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.", "You are being too modest.", "Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.", "That is a very, very funny story.", "Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.", "WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!", "[at Dunder-Mifflin Corporate in NY] David!", "Are we all set?", "Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.", "Thought I'd catch a show.", "Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.", "Um, how many people are you interviewing?", "Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?", "Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?", "Ah, great. No further questions.", "Okay.", "And I'm really looking forward to working with you.", "I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.", "[knock on door] Yeah.", "Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.", "Okay. Uh...", "Uh, okay.", "Stop crying.", "Ohhhhh...", "Why so you can do it?", "No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...", "Moon each other.", "All right.", "Your loss.", "Cruise control.", "There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.", "No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.", "No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.", "Yes, I...", "I have to buy another place.", "I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time.", "Who is D. Abramson?", "Why... are you here?", "I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.", "Why privately?", "Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.", "Okay.", "Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.", "Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.", "No. She's an alternate.", "So, how you been?", "Good.", "Yeah.", "Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.", "Hmm.", "Sound good. Sounds fun.", "Hmm..", "Would you excuse me for a second?", "Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together.", "I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...", "No, no. What do I do?", "What if she makes me?", "She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.", "I wasn't.", "You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.", "Wow.", "I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.", "[walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]", "Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.", "Yeah.", "First got priorities.", "Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]", "No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent.", "[holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable.", "Wait, wait. Check one more time.", "Very good [Jan nods]", "Yes, indeed.", "So, I guess we're getting back together.", "Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.", "Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly. We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery.", "Hey, everybody. The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado, [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.", "[exhales] How are you guys doing? Need anything?", "I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.", "That is Beardy.", "Mm-hmm.", "No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so...", "I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep.", "Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.", "Jan in yet?", "Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?", "Just say, \"I want to squeeze them.\" It's code. She'll know what it means.", "Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the \"motorboat\" noise] \"Brbrbrbrbr!\" also?", "[knocks on door] Hello, hello!", "Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.", "Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.", "Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.", "Thank you.", "I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, \"Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!\" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, \"Super Duper Paper. It's super duper.\" I don't know, something like that.", "Okay.", "Thank you.", "It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh! Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together. So... I may need to fill out one of those love documents again.", "Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.", "I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?", "Hey.", "Pretty good.", "Could have gone better I guess.", "Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.", "Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun.", "I can't tell you.", "Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---", "Hey! You're unstable!", "No--- We're all unstable.", "David, I did not tell her.", "So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job.", "Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions.", "You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.

I know, I know, I know. \"Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in.\" Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened.

But it's not mandatory. It's something that I... wanted to do... and so it's voluntary, really. Even though she... makes me. I think she just wants to hear my voice. Because we're no longer lovers, and she's just hurting. But things are going well with Carol. I've seen her seven times in the last few months, and I'm growing very fond of her kids.

The bouncer chases us out to Packer's Vette, jump in the Vette, he peels out, and I [laugh] I don't make it to the car.

Would you like a sandwich?\" These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.", "Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up.

In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too.

And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin. And I did too. And I grabbed this suit. And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket. And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war. And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get. And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before. Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye. And she got it, she got the suit.

Like I was a murderer or something.", "It was an accident.", "No.", "My lord my liege.", "So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?", "So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.", "Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.", "No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...", "Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.", "Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?", "Ok, I have an announcement.", "No.", "No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.", "So, like a freedom tree.", "Pam.", "Pam.", "Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.", "Excellent!", "Good work Pam.", "Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?", "Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!", "Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.", "Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.", "No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.", "No... She's in a coma.", "OK... Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.", "Yeah.", "Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!", "Nurse.", "[groaning] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.", "Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.", "Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.", "Well, just shhhh... just just...", "Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.", "Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.", "Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.", "OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...", "Sprinkles?", "[sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the p0rn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.", "Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.", "Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?", "Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?", "Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.", "Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?", "Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.", "Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.", "Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.", "Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.", "OK.", "Alright.", "Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.", "Are you sure?", "What are you?", "OK, 1 Sikh, and...", "You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.", "Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.", "Oh God, Rabies?", "I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?", "This place is so cursed.", "[walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.", "Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.", "Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?", "Pro-Am.", "A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.", "Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?", "Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.", "That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?", "Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.", "Yes.", "OK. [walks away]", "Alright, alright.", "Shhh...", "I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.", "OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.", "Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.", "We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?", "Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...", "Yep.", "You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?", "What about a rabies nurse?", "That's possible. Look into that.", "Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.", "Come in.", "Hey, hey, hey", "What are you doing?", "No I didn't, just please don't...", "May I enter the room?", "See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.", "Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.", "European offices are naked all the time.", "Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...", "That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.", "Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?", "OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.", "No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?", "He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.", "Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?", "Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.", "You got it?", "OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.", "Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.", "[pulls Toby's pants down] Beow!", "On your left!", "I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab]", "No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!", "Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.", "That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.", "[laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?", "[Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans]", "[runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.", "[bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]", "I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...", "What do you want me to do Jim?", "No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.", "That's a good deal.", "Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.", "You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.", "You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my pen1s. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!", "Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.", "Hey Mer. How ya doing?", "It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.", "Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?", "I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.", "Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff]", "[reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.", "Oh really.", "Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...", "[turns to address Jim and Pam] No way.", "Woooah! Wow!", "Awesome!", "You guys! Yes! Yes!", "Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.", "I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]", "No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.", "Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.", "No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]", "Blowing up balloons I thought.", "Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.", "Hey!", "There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.", "Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..", "...business meeting --", "That's right! That's right!", "Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.", "Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...", "Beard.", "Oh, wow!", "That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.", "Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.", "Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?", "Sounds good. OK, alright.", "Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, \"Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.\" His words.", "OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.", "Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave]", "Who is?", "I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.", "Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?", "Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?", "Good, so, we're on the same page?", "We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.", "Hey.", "[holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?", "I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.", "Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.", "Well...", "What is that... word?", "So older people have just as many rights as younger people?", "Good, we're all here, we can get started.", "Have a seat.", "Have a seat. Like everybody else.", "Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.", "Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?", "No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like \"where's the Beef?\" [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.", "I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.", "[puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]", "Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door]", "Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other]", "Bob, how old are you?", "Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?", "Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.", "Wow.", "Oh, boy.", "Great.", "Great.", "That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?", "Perfect. [starts closing the door]", "Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]", "No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.", "Good night guys. [staff leaves the office]", "I disagree, I think it was very valuable.", "I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.", "Smell that. Do you smell that?", "No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.", "Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.", "Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.", "Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.", "I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.", "With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.", "Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. \"You can't be on the team\", \"You can't move on to second grade\". Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.", "OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.", "Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?", "Yes?", "OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.", "Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.", "Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]", "No, this is my quest.", "Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.", "We don't need luck.", "But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.", "Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.", "It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.", "I know. So who's next?", "Who?", "[places the gift basket on top of the table] Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?", "Yes we do.", "Well...", "Mmhmm.", "OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.", "Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.", "Alright.", "[driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?", "That is true.", "Yes, she is nuts.", "How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.", "And the last guy says \"No, hairy body\".", "Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?", "She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.", "OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?", "Ah... .is that all you have to say?", "Look, we want you back.", "Well, no.", "No it's not.", "Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.", "Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.", "Great, the magic of the gift basket.", "OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.", "I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.", "That is a very good point, Dwight.", "No, it said right, it said take a right.", "Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right]", "The machine knows where it is going!", "The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!", "Let go, let go of me!", "[watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK?", "Good, that is what's most important.", "What a disaster, this whole thing.", "These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.", "What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. \"I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy\". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.", "Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!", "We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!", "Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.", "Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch]", "Look, my clothes are so wet!", "It's been opened.", "What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?", "WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?", "May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.", "Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.", "I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.", "Exactly!", "Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. [looks at Ryan] Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.", "Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.", "And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination.", "We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall]", "Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.", "Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?", "Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a \"Where's Waldo.\" [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen]", "[everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead.", "That was awesome. Thank you.", "Some days I am just on fire. What can I say?", "Oh, does he?", "Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you.", "And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.", "Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen...", "The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight.", "No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.", "What's that, pipsqueak?", "Ohh, lunch party.", "Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.", "Okay.", "Really?", "It's the European cut.", "Umm... hey. Ah, what's hanging?", "Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?", "I had um, one of those danishes.", "Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun.", "Just...", "Yeah.", "Thank you.", "Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.", "Do I have your permission to invite Carol?", "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.", "So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins.", "Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.", "Just let me know who the winner is.", "Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.", "Yes. Thank you.", "Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you. [kissing noise, kissing noise] I love ya Pam... okay. [singing] I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?", "If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow.", "You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham]", "Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured...", "Same sort of stuff in here.", "Mmwa. Mmwa.", "Leaving Pennsylvania.", "One for me one for Jan.", "You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?", "Wanna come over Friday?", "After work you guys...", "Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So...", "What are you doing?", "No.", "No, I'm sure that's not. Na...", "Yes.", "Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan.", "You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.", "Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?", "Yeah. I withdrew too.", "Alright who wants to party?", "Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out.", "I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.", "Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?", "Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good.", "This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.", "How we doing on time?", "Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen.", "Mmmhmm.", "Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel.", "I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...", "Yes", "Uh...", "I want it...", "I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, \"Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?\"", "Yes you can.", "Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this?", "No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!", "Good news.", "Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?", "Same thing.", "You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.", "Pizza by Alfredo.", "Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?", "[sighs, walks back into office]", "Yup.", "You don't have to say it like that.", "Hey", "Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.", "Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.", "You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?", "Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.", "[sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?", "It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story.", "I'm not giving that to you.", "No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out.", "You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room.", "Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you.", "No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here.", "You ready to give me my discount now?", "Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?", "Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man.", "No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?", "Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that's called sales.", "Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.", "Stop talking all at once!", "Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?", "You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.", "I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.", "I think you're over-thinking it.", "Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...", "Trouble. Okay, alright.", "He said no.", "No, no.", "Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?", "I'll just wave and introduce myself.", "Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.", "Hey, have you seen Jim?", "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?", "Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid.", "I could have paid for the pizza.", "Oh my God, oh my God.", "This is Michael.", "You're breaking up. I can't hear you.", "[to Dwight] Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.", "I will open the door.", "And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.", "Yes.", "See ya, drive safely.", "[pizza guy flips him off] Okay.", "Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.", "Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.", "What a horrible day.", "Bluh.", "Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what?", "I'm going to get it.", "Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.", "New York. Wanna go?", "Alright, you drive.", "Here we go.", "Mmm.", "Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let's go.", "Guilty.", "Oh, thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer.", "Yeah.", "[mocking Ryan] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face.", "I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.", "I made it with my cheese pita.", "I started a fire, I started a fire.", "And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...", "Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.", "Wanna head back?", "Coat! [throws coat at Pam]", "Steak! Where's my steeaaak?", "Get me Armani.", "On the phone.", "Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter]", "I owe you an apology.", "Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.", "Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.", "I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.", "We already have a sofa. So why do---", "It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.", "I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?", "Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.", "It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs--- [phone rings]", "Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!", "Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.", "Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.", "[looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.", "Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.", "Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.", "You can not, I have a thing tonight.", "What?", "Oh no, I have a thing tonight.", "How about this weekend?", "Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.", "You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.", "I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy.", "I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.", "Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.", "No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!", "These meetings are useless.", "Very inspirational. [laughter]", "Or a trained seal. [laughter]", "Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?", "I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---", "...Stanley?", "[Spanish accent] Senor, are you happy with your---", "[speaking with a different voice] Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?", "Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.", "You bet.", "Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---", "It is not a waste of our time.", "Vikram doesn't have my people skills.", "Well, I hope this conversation has helped.", "What did you get tonight?", "Oh, that looks good.", "I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.", "Thank you.", "Really?", "Wonder what I would've been back home?", "I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.", "I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.", "You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.", "I actually wrote a movie.", "I'm writing one, yeah.", "Um, sort of a spy, thriller...", "Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.", "Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'?", "Okay. How's yoga?", "Wh-Why not?", "Okay.", "Good night Vikram.", "Hey, congrats on the bonus.", "I'm gonna have it one of these nights.", "Good night.", "Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.", "Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!", "Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.", "And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.", "Why?", "No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.", "My other boss, Mr. Figaro.", "What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.", "It won't.", "Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]", "Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?", "Huh, okay.", "It's whoever, not whomever.", "No, whomever is never actually right.", "Not a native speaker.", "Well it sounds right, but is it?", "Thank you.", "No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.", "I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life. So, you are filming history.", "Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs. One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---", "And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.", "In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me. But the truth is, I can't do this.", "I am.", "I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.", "Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right? A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.", "Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?", "Do you know anybody in the mob?", "Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.", "Hey guys.", "What'cha talking about? [camera pans to each face in the break room] Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having s*x, what it looks like, I know, I think---", "Hey, hey, hey.", "Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?", "Oh, I hate monkeys.", "I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.", "I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual.", "I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems, I don't. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]", "Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.", "No you didn't.", "How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.", "That is a good point.", "Like the witness protection program.", "I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life.", "I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!", "I didn't say it, I declared it.", "Yeah, tell me about it.", "You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.", "Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.", "That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core.", "Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top.", "Right.", "How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?", "No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.", "We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.", "You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.", "No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.", "She poses.", "Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?", "What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.", "[singing] Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back.", "Hey Jan.", "Not much, what's up with you?", "I'm out of answers Jan.", "I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you.", "I don't know that.", "I'll stay off the grid.", "Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up.", "That's really nice of you to say.", "I think the engineer left.", "Don't sell your implants please.", "That's nice though.", "It looks cute though.", "Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!", "Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!", "We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby.", "Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?", "Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.", "Hello hello!", "Michael Scott.", "Regional manager.", "Excited to talk ideas.", "You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.", "All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.", "I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?", "He gives the best back rubs in the office.", "Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.", "Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.", "These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes.

That might be kind of fun.", "Who else?", "[reading off piece of paper] Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis.

[chuckles] Whoa.", "Well we can do better than that.", "The waving?", "[on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry.", "Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.", "Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.", "I'm creative, Ryan.", "Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.", "Yeah!", "Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.", "All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.", "Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.", "How about never hundred hours, sir.", "Hey thanks. Thank you.", "Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.", "What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.", "I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.", "Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.", "Has anyone ever come up to you and said, \"You're not creative\"?", "Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.", "We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.

I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.", "Line it up Phyllis.", "Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.", "Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.", "Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.", "No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.", "Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.", "No. I said I hate the, the style.", "Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.", "Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?", "That'a girl.", "Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?", "Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?

The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!", "No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.", "That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!", "This is perfect.", "This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.", "But, you will not tell anyone.", "Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. [knock on the door] Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?", "Just go out, and come back in.", "What?", "Hey everyone, can I have your attention please? I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.", "No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.", "Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?", "That could not possibly be it.", "You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.", "How can I get you to stay?", "Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.", "Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were-", "Pssh, kay.", "Fillipellers, how's it hanging?", "To the left?", "To the right?", "Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.", "Yes, listen, um... You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.", "No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby.", "You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um... Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.", "Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one? [Karen hangs up]", "Hi Ben, Michael Scott.", "I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes. To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.", "[to Pam] Get out. [to Ben] Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.", "No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?", "What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House.", "Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.", "What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples.", "Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?", "That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words.", "What? What? We did?", "Look at his face! Look at his face!", "What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?", "We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.", "Uh-huh.", "Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim.", "We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.", "In your face", "Are you calling Karen?", "Yep, get it.", "It had to be done, it had to be done.", "Hey Dwight, he found it.", "Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.", "Do you really wanna know?", "Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.", "No, no, not real bombs.", "Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.", "It could be badass. Yeah, it will.", "Teach her to offer Stanley more money.", "So, why did you and Karen break up? Was it the s*x?", "I can't imagine the s*x being bad, I mean her body is...", "...awesome.", "Okay, I will start. Um, \"A.\" [singing] \"A\" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell... Damn it! What do we sell?

Dwight, are you peeing?", "Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!", "I'll kill you man!", "That is just so disgusting!", "Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?", "Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I-", "You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.", "[from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell.", "There's a guy, there's a guy.", "Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.", "We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier.", "It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running.", "Aha! [crashing]", "We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us.", "Save yourself!", "Dwight, you gotta move!", "Dwight, could you move over a little bit.", "Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.", "Just say you wanna get back together.", "It doesn't have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.", "[whispers] Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. [they get up to leave]", "We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.

Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]", "Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping.

And I would survive.", "Well...", "You...", "You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real.

The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now.

Doesn't even matter.", "Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment.

I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.", "Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load.

I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits.

When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?", "When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.", "Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away]", "[leans across to Pam whispering] Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.", "I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.

Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.", "Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.", "Would she get into trouble?", "I will take the fall. I did it.", "Jim? Pam?", "No.", "Nope.", "Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.", "[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?", "Hmm...", "Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.", "Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?", "I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.", "What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.", "Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85.

Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?", "I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question.", "Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!", "What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.", "Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.", "Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear \"Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la.\" No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do.

No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.", "Hmm..", "Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad.", "That would be bad.", "Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.", "What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.", "Oh you can't because I don't care.

[Michael dials phone number. Phone rings.]", "Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael.", "Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?", "[under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?", "Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.", "Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah.", "Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...", "That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.", "She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young.", "Oh, God. Oh...", "Try not to be so hurtful Jim.", "Please, not at a time like this. [sighs]", "Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?", "I don't, I don't think I'm ready.

OK...", "So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...", "Just making conversation.", "Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?", "You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. [holds up cell phone with a picture of Jan] Look at that.", "Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.", "Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.", "Now you ruined it. [gets up and leaves]", "Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?", "Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately.

Ah yeah, that's nice.", "[sighs]", "I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures.

I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie.", "Back to the Future? [she shakes head] Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.", "Forty... I'm in my forties.", "Nuhh...", "Oh, OK.", "You are welcome.", "This place is like sexy pre-school.", "I would love a place where we could meet older girls.", "Ahh, wow. That's dangerous.", "You're kidding.", "I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool.", "I am a bank teller.", "Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.", "I think so.", "Yeah, I have fun.", "All right.", "Very perfect. [girl walks away, Michael laughs] Oh my [notices Dwight making out with Tall Girl #1] This needs to be shared. [takes a picture with his camera phone] [Cut to the office - All Office co-workers cell phones go off. They notice the picture Michael has sent and all groan]", "She washes dogs.", "I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom.", "Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy]", "Hmm...", "[on phonne] I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not... [Ryan is dancing feverishly and falls over] Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.", "[Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad.", "Well...", "Pretty weird.

Dwight. Leave him alone.", "Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.", "Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it.", "Best night ever.", "Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys?

Haha, come on!", "[with petroleum jelly on his face] Hurry, please.", "[muffled] That's what she said.", "Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, \"That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole...\" I dunno, it's a good feeling.", "All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...", "Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.", "Ener-gize...", "Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?", "Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?", "Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...", "An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...", "Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.", "Stanley, we're havin a little...", "We're havin a little brainstorm session...", "...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.", "Ugh, what?", "What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.", "That? In the conference room?", "We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said \"did I stutter,\" and I said \"wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?\" It was joking, Toby, alright?", "Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another[/b]: \"Hey um, you're poor.\" \"Well hey, you're mama's dead.\" That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.", "Mmhmm.", "Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...", "Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.", "I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.", "Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.", "Uh huh...", "Great", "What's the pink?", "Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?", "Other than me.", "I never said you could do that.", "I...", "Okay, I will think about it.", "No.", "Hey.", "Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang?", "It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...", "I know, it's very, very personal...", "I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?", "God.", "Okay.", "Okay, so dig this[/b]: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.", "Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?", "What is that?", "Really?", "I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.", "Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.", "It's like a mock execution.", "Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.", "No, okay... I've had enough of you.", "Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?", "I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act. [Stanley enters the room] Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?", "Stanley Hudson, you are fired.", "I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.", "Hmm.", "Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.", "That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?", "Okay...", "Yes.", "That's not-", "All right, all right...", "Okay.", "Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.", "Everybody, except Stanley.", "[starts to cry] I don't understand why you keep picking on me.", "You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.", "Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.", "All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.", "I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. [as Rodney Dangerfield] Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after s*x, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, \"I don't respect you!\" Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. [as Jeff Foxworthy] If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck.

I don't get no respect!", "So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?", "Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.", "Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!", "Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.", "Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood.

Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college.", "Let's go!", "[Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think?", "This is all we need.", "Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities!

Excuse me.", "Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, \"only the best and the brightest.\"", "He's totally wrong, Pam. [to Justin] Hey.", "How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. [takes back the info flyer Justin holds] Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.", "Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper.

I need a smart intern.", "[teen approaches table] Hello there.", "Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company...", "Dammit, Oscar!", "Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being \"lured\" these days.

I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.", "Yes. And don't call me Shirley.", "All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.", "Hey!

What's your last name?", "This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?", "Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot!

Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.", "This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will \"do\" you. [laughs] No, no.

I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.", "So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better.

I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.", "Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird.

That's my watch.", "Hey, that's good.", "[still watching video of Ryan] Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.", "[voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend.", "Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.", "I'm cool.", "Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.", "No antigravity machine, huh?", "Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.", "That's what she... a lot of places are like that.", "Thanks.", "I like, uh...", "Hey. What are you doing?", "What the hell is going on here?!", "There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!", "Why did you do that?", "No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right?", "Shh...", "I'm really sorry.", "Yeah...", "Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee!

Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. [applause] You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?", "Probably the best one that we have ever had, right?

I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...", "You did?", "When we were going out?", "W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.", "You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?", "IHop.", "I'm glad you told me.", "Um, I'll... I have to think about it.", "My whole life, I have known two things[/b]: I love s*x, and I want to have kids.

I wasn't exactly looking at the road.", "You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith. I'll start. I liked her jumpers. They reminded me of Kindergarten. Jim?", "Hey! Okay, okay, okay, You can just close that.", "Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?

[sighs] And we need to do something about it.", "Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex. I'm just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed. Conference room, 10 minutes.", "On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed.

I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...", "Is that good?", "OK.", "Darryl, would you do the honors?", "Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning. This is a good day.

And you look... you look fantastic.", "Yeah.", "Do some... do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings.

What time we got? [checks watch] You know what? That's a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right... what is wrong. Who's to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is... unknowable. But, let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate.", "Oh...", "Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks. Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.", "No... no, this is just a stupid formality.", "Well, well. Holly... lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk.", "Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.", "Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch?", "Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady. [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses] Sorry! You know what? Let's go out!

Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines?", "Wow, that sounds so... warm.", "Here too. You know what my favorite season is?", "Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.", "Wow, terminator, terminator.", "Yeah.", "I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.

We just punish her.", "Mmhmm, tell her she can't have s*x for six months.", "I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.", "No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about.

I don't...", "Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.", "I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.

Kendall, my main man.", "Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.", "How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, \"I told you so.\" Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.", "Ok, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.", "Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! [everyone gets up to go in the conference room]", "Now is really not the time, Meredith.", "Yeah.", "OK, just remember to keep breathing.", "OK, good.", "Oh, OK! OK!", "I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.", "I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.", "I checked the route - there are no potholes.

It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments?", "She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...", "I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?", "It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.", "[banging on the glass] Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don't talk to them.", "Make the party. Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis. [Phyllis starts inflating a balloon with a pump] Pump it!", "Ahoy, matey.", "Ahoy. So, how you doin'?", "Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way.", "So this is Astird.", "Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me?", "I could have helped.", "Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.", "No, I don't!", "Can I hold her?", "[cradling the car seat awkwardly] All right, OK.", "I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible.

No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.", "I could have helped.", "[smiling] Uh, yeah.", "[voiceover] I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.", "Phyllis? Could you take-.", "Hey guys.", "Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.", "Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?", "I just saw this baby daddy-", "Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?", "Well-", "It's- that's different.", "That's not a baby.", "[sighs] Could I?", "[sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to... I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.", "Sure you can't stay a little longer?", "All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving.", "OK?", "Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God!

It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.", "You're welcome.", "In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have s*x. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having s*x with me I'll know for sure.", "Yeah.", "Some of what we order depends on whether we're having s*x after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have s*x tonight?", "Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.", "Probably get soup or something light.", "No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes.

Very sweet... ah.", "Alright.", "Very cool.", "Okay.", "Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.", "Wow!", "Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!", "A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered.", "Guys, she's in there.", "Let's do this.", "[goes up to concierge from the hotel] Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott. Good to see you again.", "Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.", "Works in accounting. This is uh, concierge Marie...", "...who works at our hotel. You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.", "And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---", "She's foreign. I am--", "Oh, thank you.", "Thank you, Andy.", "Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with.", "How about this one? It's Christmas eve---", "---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do? What do you do? Come on! What do you do?", "Unbelievable! Unbelievable.", "[standing outside hotel room... whispering] Do you want to get some breakfast or something?", "Okay.", "Slept like a baby.", "Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here. They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter. They are treated like human beings. [sighs]", "Yes.", "Yeah, we locked him up for two years.", "No. Actually the trip sucked.", "The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.", "I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.", "And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.", "It was not, it sucked.", "Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige. That was great. That was great. That was--- that was a---", "That was a really good choice.", "No, David. You listen to me. Why did you send her away? That--- God. You knew I liked her and you just sent her away. And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.", "That was a really sucky thing to do.", "Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone. That's respect.", "Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.", "Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?", "Heh, okay, weirdo.", "She said she was going to give it to him right now. [starts laughing]", "Yeah, they used to.", "Oh, can you imagine?", "Uhhgh.", "I don't know. What?", "Hmmm, dare I? [laughs] You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake. [walks to the annex, standing in Toby's cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby]", "NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!", "[watching Toby at Phyllis' desk through his office blinds] Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid... tan. No.", "No.", "He looks worse.", "Uh, well I'm afraid not. Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.", "Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.", "Yes.", "I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls. Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.", "I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.", "That's true. People say it's icky.", "David, wait.", "Is there no way we can get rid of him?", "I have cause. It is be-cause I hate him.", "No.", "I don't.", "[Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael's shoulders] Don't do that.", "You want to see some really high caliber acting? Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man. Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.", "You're welcome. Missed you. Missed you as part of our family.", "So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun.", "Nice beaches, pristine beaches?", "Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay?", "I bet, for you.", "[shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.", "Yeah, I am. I am.", "I tried, I tried. I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail. I feel like I'm dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends. I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.", "Okay, just summarize.", "That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.", "Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started.", "What are you doing?", "For what?", "No, no, no.", "You're the bait for Toby?", "No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me.", "Yes, sure they do, Dwight.", "Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.", "Oh, oooh his mistress. No. I'm kidding. No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.", "Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson? I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits. Do not read it beforehand. Can you do that for me?", "Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don't.", "Pam. Pam, you gave me your word.", "Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?", "Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?", "You mad? You mad at me?", "Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?", "Huh? He might do it...", "I dare you to. Come on.", "What's the matter... haaaww!", "Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?", "No do it, do it. I dare you.", "Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon...", "Son of a bitch.", "[mouth full of brownie] Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.", "What's that?", "Frame him?", "I've never framed a man before, have you?", "Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes the ends justify the mean.", "Hello. I've seen you guys around. I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. How you doing? [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here? I need to purchase something.", "No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...", "Grass, weed?", "I heard you drug--- I heard you dealt.", "I'm not wearing a wire, so...", "How much? How many pounds is it?", "Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot...", "Those are real cops, real guns. I wonder what's going on. [follows them]", "Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.", "Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?", "No, no no no... No, no.", "No, that was... that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate.", "Oh God!", "No, no no no no.", "God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is. And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!", "Ahh, that's mine.", "Yes, it's mine.", "Are you kidding me? That's my salad.", "You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.", "Hmm.", "Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.", "Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about? You're... you're worried about the cop's time? You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.", "You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So...", "Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.", "Do you want to hear a lie?", "I think you're great. You're my best friend.", "Mmm... okay.", "Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.", "Yes.", "There's the x-ax...icks.", "Mmhmm, okay.", "Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.", "Ho-oh!", "Yeah.", "I'll be six.", "So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.", "[whistles poorly] Whoo.", "Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...", "Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess?", "No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?", "So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?", "Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.", "Alright, so, teams forming.", "You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.", "Yes.", "Why me?", "Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.", "Yes.", "I don't know. I haven't decided yet.", "Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.", "Yes.", "Ohh, God!", "Yeah!", "Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!", "All right! Cool!", "I have no idea.", "[through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?", "Yeah.", "Yeah?", "Oh, hey.", "I do.", "it was fun. We had a good time.", "Oh, thank you.", "Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.", "You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.", "Nine dollars. The boys' department.", "Look at the ass. Check out the ass.", "Look at that. [begins dancing] Unh. Unh-unh.", "Yes they were.", "They were.", "Mmhmm.", "Sits on a copier.", "Yeah.", "Very valid.", "All right.", "See ya.", "[laughs] Hahaha!... well...", "Okay.", "Oh, thank you my dear.", "Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...", "There he is! Hello, hello!", "Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.", "Mm! [gives Jim a high five] Yeah!", "Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!", "Oh... ah, I almost choked.", "Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.", "Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want.", "Yes.", "Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-", "Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.", "It is, yes.", "What?", "Okay.", "Oh, there we go.", "Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.", "So, the copier.", "All right, yes.", "Well, what should I do?", "All right, get out. Get out.", "Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.", "No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry.", "Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.", "No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.", "The what now?", "...Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!", "I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.", "All right, attention everyone.", "I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.", "Pam, would you stand up for a sec? [sits in Pam's chair] Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. [slowly sinking into the chair] Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers? [the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where Michael is not visible over the desk] They don't have copiers. They don't even- [struggles to get up from Pam's chair] Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.", "Do I know what?", "Mm, no...", "$645.", "Right.", "Because that is how my mind works.", "Let's see...", "I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.", "This is so stupid.", "This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone.", "To be continued!", "No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.", "[groans in frustration] You think it's easy?", "Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?", "It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey.", "What?", "Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-", "[wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.", "Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?", "Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.", "Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out.", "Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.", "This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.", "Alright... One more time around the block.", "Jim, Jim....", "That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.", "Yeah.", "I know.", "[sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India.", "Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth", "No, no. I celebrate privately.", "Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.", "We'll do it quickly.", "[mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--", "Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.", "An intervention. It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions. And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves. And then they stop.", "Okay, how do you feel?", "Uck... T.M.I.", "Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.", "I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.", "Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]", "The aye's have it.", "Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]", "Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?", "Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?", "Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?", "I got it on a website, that's not important.", "Okay, you know what Toby? One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this. I'm doing your job man. Hey, are you texting?", "Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you? Come on people. If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better. [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.", "That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.", "Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything?", "Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke? Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?", "Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Hey-- come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.", "I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.", "You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.", "[amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?", "Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.", "Dwight--", "[sighs]...okay.", "Enabler! Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler. It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.", "You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.", "[whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?", "We did?", "Oh, shoot. Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.", "We could go there, sure.", "Yes, yes.", "I have a new place.", "It-- yep, recently.", "All right.", "Yeah, oh there you go.", "That's good.", "We're party girls.", "It's okay. It's all right.", "Meredith, we are doing this for your own good. Okay. Come on--", "Here we go. This is gonna be good.", "Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car]", "Shhh... just calm down.", "[chasing Meredith] Come on. Shh...", "Here's the door. Here's the door.", "[dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?", "I have a deposit. Alcoholic.", "So do I sign?", "As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. They have to hit rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom. Um... I think I can do it. I did it with Jan.", "[heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!", "No. No, no. There was wind.", "Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.", "I want another try. Here we go! [Michael runs past the radar as a car passes] Thirty-one! Thirty-one!", "I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.", "Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.", "Beat it!", "Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.", "Wait, you still don't know...", "You still don't know.", "[to Jim] What are you doing?", "Andy.", "[from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is...", "No, that's not it.", "[sighs] How can he still not know?", "I can't take it anymore.", "I am telling Andy.", "Who should it come from, then?", "[to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes']", "Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes']", "Well?", "You know this can't go on.", "We have to put an end to this.", "Come on. [Dwight and Jim follow into Michael's office]", "When will she be ready?", "Is she crazy in bed?", "How so, specifically?", "Really?", "It's too late.", "I am already walking.", "Okay, what does that mean?", "[sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.", "Thanks. [to Andy] Andy?", "Walk with me.", "Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear...", "Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.", "Which will be fine. I am off!", "Thank you! [gets into his car]", "[through the car window] Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...", "[rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.", "All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh.", "Yep. [drives off]", "Right what?", "David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.", "Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.", "This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.", "[pokes his head in] Hey, what say we order up some pasta?", "So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, \"Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?\" And he looks at me and he says, \"Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.\" And I look back at him and I say, \"I feel the need!... The need for tweed.\"", "[rises] Oh, thank you.", "I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.", "Okay. [sits back down to continue eating]", "Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh!", "What you talking bout, Wallace? [imitating What you talking bout Willis]", "Hi, I am well, how are you?", "Oh, have you not?", "Yeah.", "Okay.", "Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?", "Oh, well, then, email it to me.", "I will seduce her.", "No, I will seduce her.", "No, I got it.", "Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.", "Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies", "Michael Scarn.", "Okay.", "[interrupting] No.", "No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.", "Oh, don't start,", "You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.", "You will have pancakes and you'll like it.", "So what?", "Maybe they are shrinking.", "They could be shrinking.", "Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup.", "Mm hmm .", "And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.", "Argh, why are you all...", "Shut up.", "Ready to do this?", "Good. Here come the sharks. [they imitate jaws theme sounds and Dwight makes shark fin on his forehead]", "In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.", "Hello.", "My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.", "Thank you.", "We are a law firm.", "You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question [reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it] for you would be [reading off sheet] how many clients do you have?", "Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.", "Ah, so when did you set up shop?", "Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .", "So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?", "Well that is... because... I am a genius.", "Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.", "Try 80.", "Hey, hey, how is your interview going?", "Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?", "I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great [positioning her towards sign of Prince Family Paper customers] Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left [positions Linda to get better picture]", "What's going on? Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?", "Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?", "Excellent! Way to go! Nice! [Michael and granddaughter Prince exchange high fives]", "Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision.", "I... Okay, okay, okay, [in disbelief] alright, thank you. [heads towards Dwight, makes make out lips signal]", "Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.", "I cannot wait to contact your clients.", "Haha, we struck the mother load!", "Wallace is going to freak.", "He's going to absolutely freak.", "Oh shoot.", "Oh God, what was that?", "Aw, it's alright.", "Aw, my car.", "No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.", "Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...", "No, no, really not necessary.", "You know let me give you some money for this.", "Oh coffee, that's too much. [Dwight drinks it]", "Thank you.", "Ok, goodbye Prince Family.", "Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?", "Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.", "Why don't we just, live and let live?", "Live and let live.", "It's from James Bond.", "I'm not going to make this call.", "My heart says...", "That is true.", "That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.", "Jan... Ryan.", "You're right.", "You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.", "Just something I have to do first.", "Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]", "Oh shoot! [gets to his car turns around]", "Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door]", "Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.", "Im not a shark.", "[pained] Mpfh.", "Thank you.", "Okay, bye bye.", "I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?", "Oh, hey what is this?", "Oh, she is hot. [\"Hillary Swank is hot\" supporters cheer]", "Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm.", "Stay [bleep] calm!", "Everyone, now [bleep] calm down!", "What does warm mean?", "Don't run.", "Get out of the way! Go, go, go!", "Okay, we're trapped.

We are livid. But we are going to let this one slide.", "I am not a mind reader, David.", "And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like.", "Do you?", "You talking to me?", "What?", "[sighs] No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands.", "Yeah.", "That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.", "Yes.", "I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out.", "No, I will.", "Nobody should have to go to work thinking, \"Oh, this is the place that I might die today.\" That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.

That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means \"always be closing.\"", "Shut it. Shut it.", "We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.", "You know who I really think should go? Stanley.", "Come on.", "No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.

You're losing you. Do it!", "This is you we're talking about.", "Okay, okay. I'll show them. Here we go. [whispers] Stanley. All right.", "No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs.", "Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?", "How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.", "okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour?", "I will divide and then count to it.", "Yes, yes I do. I love that song.

David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.", "Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?", "Let's hear it.", "[in a monk-impression tone] Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me.

You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.", "Too expensive.", "Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.", "Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?", "You have stress?", "During our relaxation exercise?", "No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.", "Let me getcha.", "Ok, alright.", "Ok. [beeping slows down]", "Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley's monitor now] Let's give this a shot.", "Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer]", "So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.", "I don't get it. Do I stress you out?", "Oh...", "Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.", "Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. [Jim shakes his head at the camera] You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...", "What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...", "Si senor.", "It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.", "I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.", "Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.

Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.", "Idiot.", "Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?", "Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.", "We are, we are a family.", "Oh very funny.", "Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?", "I don't believe I have had the pleasure.", "Jefferson.", "Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um...

And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. [looks towards the sky] I'm okay. No, I'm not.", "I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.", "Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela? [Angela raises her hand] Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted.

And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. [Stanley is still laughing] Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid.

Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. [laughs] No, uh, seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. [looks at Pam] Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.", "No!

Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? That's...", "...kind of [retches] Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.", "No. Oh, all right.", "No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.", "Then listen to your iPod, Pam.", "Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.", "You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...", "Is that why your wearing makeup today?", "Hello, Rolando, how are you?", "Rolando, [clears throat] I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist.

That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you... [hangs up phone, sighs] This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. [Karen raises her hand] Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?", "I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience.

That's it.", "[to Jim] Who's there?", "Dwight, get the door.", "Answer the door.", "I'm not gonna answer it", "Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.", "Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!", "No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!", "The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.", "I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.", "Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'", "No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.", "No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?", "Woo hoo.", "Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...", "...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?", "Invite them on the tour.", "Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?", "Yeah?", "Yeah.", "I thought I did. So...", "Well no harm no foul.", "You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.", "Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.", "Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?", "Irrelevant.", "OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?", "My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs]", "Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?", "No, they can't.", "Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.", "Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -", "Thank you, Jim is with me.", "Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.", "OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.", "OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]", "That is not constructive.", "[on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--", "How are you doing?", "[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.", "Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.", "I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.", "You're breaking up.", "OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.", "Yes.", "No.", "[long pause] Yes.", "[Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.", "Woah, wow, who told you that?", "[same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.", "I'm not taking... I'm not taking...", "Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.", "Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.", "Why do you have a diary?", "OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.", "Yes, you did.", "What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary]", "Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?", "We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--", "Umm, nacho chips.", "Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.", "Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.", "[sighs] It's not ready yet.", "I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.", "May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.", "Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.", "He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.", "I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...", "Right.", "That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.", "That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...", "You kind of have.", "Yes.", "[seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.", "Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?", "Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?", "Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?", "Give me the details of how that happened.", "What?", "David? David?", "David?", "Could I be a part of the meeting also?", "There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.", "I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.", "OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?", "Oh how dare you.", "You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?", "Oh please.", "Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...", "...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.", "They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.", "Thank You!", "Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.", "When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.", "I want to see it.", "I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary]", "Give me... Give me the diary.", "I like it.", "I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.", "And classy, yeah.", "[watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.", "Yes.", "He is.", "That's what makes him classy.", "Strawberries?", "Not classy at all.", "French. Classy.", "[on speakerphone] Yes?", "Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?", "Uh-huh. [comes out of office] Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. [shakes Charles' hand] At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. [leads round of applause] Here he is.", "Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . [whispers] Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.", "Yes.", "What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.", "You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.", "Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! [swings arm above head for everyone to come, hits doorframe] Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!", "Surprise! [unveils bagels sitting on table] As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.", "Took me all night.", "I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. [in British cockney accent] It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.", "All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.", "Oh, nerd alert!", "This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.", "This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange [points to Andy]", "There you go! Where's the other?", "Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.", "Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. [claps]", "Oh! Well...", "Above and beyond.", "That's true.", "No. Absolutely not.", "Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.", "Well, why don't-", "Charles is going to tell you.", "Well, it's not official.", "Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.", "Well-", "Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. [starts round of applause] He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.", "Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.", "I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.", "[on speakerphone] David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.", "It was my understanding.", "Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.", "But the branch is still mine?", "Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?", "Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence]", "I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.", "Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?", "Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.", "You're not from paper?", "Does David know this?", "Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-", "And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?", "Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.", "Whatever David wants.", "[on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.", "No! You idiot! [hangs up] Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god. [redials]", "Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.", "And I really really need to talk to David.", "I was never given a name. [hangs up, he and Dwight sigh in relief]", "Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?", "I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.", "Nobody thanked me.", "For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.", "[on phone] Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!", "Yep.", "Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.", "Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.", "Yes it is!", "No, it is not.", "Ok, so we're on the same page, great.", "Ok, Michael, what are you doing?", "No, seriously.", "How old are you?", "Five years old?", "I'm gonna walk away.", "I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.", "What is that smaller stripper holding?", "Ok.", "Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.", "Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.", "It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.", "But it's cool, and it's-", "Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .", "Yeah, why don't you do that?", "Yeah, here we go. Ok.", "What?", "Newsflash[/b]: I've been here for fifteen years. Headline[/b]: You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!", "Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. [gets jacket] I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. [pushes chair as he leaves]", "Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? [looks into empty office]", "[points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?", "I drove.", "Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.", "Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?", "Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.", "Clearly that's what you wanted.", "Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.", "I've put having a family on hold.", "And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.", "I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.", "Ok.", "[gets up to shake David's hand] I quit.", "You have no idea how high I can fly.", "I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit. I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go. Feeling good. Listen to some tunes. Should've peed before I left.", "Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door.", "No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!", "I looked at Wallace and I said \"I quit!\" and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said \"You have no idea how high I can fly.\"", "Why would I do that?", "You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.", "Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. [in Oscar's ear] Clinky, clinky-clink. Come-on... come on, come on.", "[slightly drunk] What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. I gonna stay up all day. Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO! And I'm going to stop worrying about calories.", "I have a job.", "Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted.", "Any good headhunter knows I am available.", "You're 'I need you to' is my command.", "Hey.", "You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. [eats some spaghetti] Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!", "Oh! Hey. What is this about?", "Oh.", "Me too, me too. Is this wine?", "I already have wine.", "Hmm?", "For?", "Yes I am.", "Where you from?", "That's a drive!", "[sighs]", "Thank you. [groaning ceases]", "You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. [dials phone]", "[sighs] What am I gong to do? Uh... [chuckles].", "PSST! PSST!", "Okay, oh okay, okay. Close your eyes.", "Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.", "yeah!", "Can you believe... cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know about paper.", "Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.", "Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.", "Close them.", "Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?", "Obviously.", "Oh, agreed, mmm, except...", "Hey hey... what's up Chuck?", "No I'm staying.", "Pam, listen. This order form. Instead of saying \"Dunder Mifflin\" at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?", "You... oh. Somebody has been talking in bed. Pillow talk.", "This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.", "Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that?", "Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?", "Thank you very much.", "I'm starting my own paper company.", "Yeah.", "Yeah. In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in.", "Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so", "Potential, lots of potential. yes.", "It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...", "That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.", "So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.", "I made it sterile.", "I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.", "No, no no.", "Okay.", "Okay, hey, you already have the job. You don't have to convince me.", "[from inside the restroom] Stanley?", "Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.", "Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.", "Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.", "You know what. I had a great time at prom. And no one said 'Yes' to that either.", "Hmm?", "Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks...", "Hank? You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Hank, please escort Charles from the building.", "[to everyone] Well here we are... I would just like to...", "[yelling from Parking lot] Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!", "... and I feel free!", "Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!", "Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.", "I was going to, I wanted to. But I had to start somewhere.", "No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer?", "So which way are you leaning?", "Thanks Jim.", "Okay, Okay, we don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me people. Stop. Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me. Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height. Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future. Hello, I am your future. You're older, and you are very happy now. Because you went with Michael Scott. Right. So everybody come on down. Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright? Come on! Are you, are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be? [Pam is thinking hard] Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot. Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on Phyllis. Here we go, here we go!", "Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!", "I think maybe Hank should be here.", "You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. [Charles steps towards Michael] Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.", "You are?", "Okay. It's going to be great.", "Right... Executive assistant.", "Alright, okay. Deal! Okay, well... Jim?", "Well, okay, lets go.", "Are people watching?", "Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.", "Bye.", "Oh, good. My hooker's here. [laughs] Hi.", "Yes I was. Yes I was.", "That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.", "Thank you. Would you like some french toast?", "What shape?", "Alright.", "After breakfast.", "So how you feeling about the new company?", "You excited? About the new company?", "After breakfast.", "No, I'm whipping them.", "Just let go.", "Let go, please. Just gimmee -", "I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.", "[doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.", "I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.", "Don't patronize me, Pam.", "I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.", "It's totally impossible!", "Assemble a sales team. A dream team.", "Okay, Ryan.", "He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.", "Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.", "He worked at that telemarketing place.", "Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.", "Yeah.", "Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.", "Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm...", "Alright.", "Oh. Wow. \"Michael Scott Paper Company.\" Okay. Very official. \"Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence.

No No. No. \"My Stumps.\" Like \"My Humps\" but a guy with no legs.", "We can do this.", "Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back.

[Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael.", "Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.", "Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.", "I'm...", "Excuse me. Yes?", "Yes, it is.", "Yes.", "It is.", "Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?", "Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?", "Uh, nine.", "[Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing.", "He's stealing them. Okay, okay.", "He's already paying for himself.", "Right here.", "Oh yeah.", "Sounds awesome.", "People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.", "Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.", "Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.", "By wanting it more. By working hard-", "Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows[/b]: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.", "And I offer same day, free delivery.", "Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.", "Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...", "Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.", "Okay.", "Okay.", "Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.", "What's that?", "Blech.", "Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.", "Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...", "I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.", "So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]", "You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.", "I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up. She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.", "[walks into room] Okay.", "It's right in the middle of the paper belt.", "Yeah, I'm good.

[Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. [realizing he's going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.", "Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.", "Is this the tape of me falling?", "No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.", "It's alright. I can handle it.", "I am a grown-up, Jim.", "I don't think you froze.", "Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.", "Oscar's a douche.", "No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit]", "You're welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell.

Thank you very much.", "[comes over to hug them both] My girls. There they are. [Pam walks away]", "Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your \"Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother\" and fixes all occurrences of \"I don't really see them together\".

The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.", "Hey--", "Please, Kevin. You're fired. [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head] Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots.

Table for four.", "What table should we take? So many to choose from.", "What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow!", "Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.", "Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.", "Oh. Thank you.

It's not anything you would have ever done.", "Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.", "You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping?", "Snowboarding?", "I might.", "[sighs] Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.", "Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to.", "So we should get the check?", "Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it.", "Yes you will.", "I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper.", "That's just an arbitrary title.", "It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.", "Oh that I plagiarized I think.", "Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.", "That was a bunt.", "Oh, just went to the bathroom.", "I got thirsty.", "Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.

That just-- you've really grown.", "[covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references.

I know.", "You gotta do something--", "How much time do you think you'll need?", "Come on, man!", "Am I scared of getting hit in the face?

Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.", "They sent a limo.", "Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble.

So... you're the moron.", "[zipping through the hall while texting]", "Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan.

Um, I am never going to forget today. Not a chance. I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today. Who here has done something stupid in their lives?

I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable. But you know what's invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know what's gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay, you're going to make me say it.

I'm not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close. And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30. Maybe by my 50s, I don't know. I wanted to pay for your education. I really did. It was my dream. Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams. My dream was in the right place.", "Okay, hold on. Hold on. Now I can't pay for your college. But you don't have to go to class to be in class.

They're lithium.", "Erin, can you give us a second?", "Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.", "What can I do?", "I can give you an extra laptop battery. Not everyone took one.

That's over $200 a year.", "For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each. I'm going to date them one year apart. Now, you are to use one check a year.

Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably \"freedom.\" At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore.", "[santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap.

It's a struggle] Oh my God.", "What would you like for Christmas little boy?", "What did you think was going to happen?", "All right, just say \"some toys\" please.", "Damn it Kevin, come on.", "Okay get off, get off! [pushes Kevin off] Oh! Oh, God!", "Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.", "Ryan come here!", "Come on, come on.", "Ahhh... Ho ho ho! [struggles to pull Ryan towards him] Come on I need this. Come over here!", "Just sit down!", "Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!", "Whoop! Okay, what?", "Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!", "Do you understand, you forced my hand?", "Oh, do we? Do \"We?\" Is that what \"we\" want? Why don't \"we\" take a vote on it?", "Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--", "No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we --[Dwight counts the raised hands] Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?", "I'll get some punch. That looks delicious.

Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!", "Well, I am heading down there.", "How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket]", "I did!", "You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -", "All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.", "Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.", "Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch.", "No is not an option.", "All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.", "[laughs] I'll be over there.", "Very nice.", "A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?", "Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?", "How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?", "Okay. All right.", "Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.", "Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.", "Right. What?", "Mm. mm. Oh well.", "No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.", "Hey Pack-man.", "How you doing stud? You already there?", "How's the lady situation?", "Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.", "Yeah. Maybe next year.", "How late do we have to work tonight?", "Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?", "Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.", "Hello Jo.", "There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.", "I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.", "Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day. [Starts to leave office] And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.", "Yes.", "Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!", "Drinks are on me!", "Oh -hoh! All right.", "Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something[/b]: Do I even like her? As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, \"Don't worry, be happy.\"", "Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there?", "Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is?", "Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...", "[laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.", "In my condo complex.", "I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.", "[feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?", "Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.", "No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.", "Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff.

It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.", "[speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -", "Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be..

Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was[/b]: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.", "Yeah.", "M-hmm.", "Is that all you have to say to me?", "Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]", "Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.", "You writing your memoirs over there?", "Well, it's a pretty big check.", "Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.", "I'm just saying, that -", "Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge]", "Oh, you got to be kidding me. [holds up squashed sandwich] Look at that. That's -", "You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?", "The sales department smashed my sandwich.", "You don't get it.", "That's what she said.", "Yeah.", "Thank you very much.", "Ah, just the stupid leads.", "Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. [Angela, Kevin and Oscar applaud]", "Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.", "They act like I have no power.", "Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.", "Exactly that.", "Exactly that.", "Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please?

[passes Jim some index cards]", "Alright.", "Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?", "I do understand it.", "Or is it?", "Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. [cuts to Jim fishing one of the leads out of a catering size tin of Ravioli] A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally [clue next to Jim reads[/b]: 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing [cut to scenes of chaos as everyone argues] Some people shouldn't be in this business.", "Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.", "Wait.

You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -", "Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump.\"", "Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -", "Really?", "Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories!", "You can.", "Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.", "You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.", "Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.", "[kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man.", "Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.", "No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.", "Assistant to the managed him -", "Yeah.", "You think you would have done better without me? Really?", "Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -", "You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -", "That's my wife you're talking about, man.", "If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.", "No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out.

Better!", "I'm going to give Erin $15.", "A one-on-one lunch with Erin?", "She's kind of a rube.", "Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.", "[walks over to Erin's desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.", "I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to...[Erin snaps a picture of Michael] lunch.", "Ugh.", "Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...", "Okay, well, we'll figure something.

[sighs]", "An age or month?", "I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.", "So how are things going with Andy?", "Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.", "Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.", "I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter.", "Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.", "Okay.", "I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having s*x with somebody else.", "They were engaged, so... [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?", "Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?", "Thank you.", "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "Well...", "What are you doing? What are you doing?", "Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.", "[turns to other restaurant patrons] I'll have what she's having!", "[in Michael's car] Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good.

All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.", "You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.", "Erin?", "No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?", "Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.", "Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.", "You said butt.", "Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him[/b]: \"Hey! Hey Scott!\"", "[walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? \"Oscar. I am the Count.\" Nailed him. Nailed him.

That's who I am.", "Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either.", "Hmm.", "Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?", "[in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?", "Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.", "Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.", "So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?", "Maybe wee find some wiggle room?", "I think we could.

Like for tax purposes.", "Why don't you run them again?", "If she is, it's working.", "So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...", "Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?", "I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?", "They're good [Donna grabs mint]", "Sure.", "I can't stop myself from kissing her.", "Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.", "Okay. What do you think?", "Andy?", "Okay, some for, some against.", "Pam?", "I'm going with Pam's group.", "Here we go.", "Okay.", "No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.", "What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier.

I think so.", "[whispers] Okay. So... Oh, Donna?", "Thank you so much.", "Mmm. [Donna giggles]", "[follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...", "All right. All right. Bye.", "And have a good elevator ride.", "Oh, what's that out there?", "I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.", "She suckered you too.", "Was it the cleavage?", "Yep.", "God. She left this here?", "Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.", "Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.", "[hold up barrette] Well...", "Yeah, I know. I know.", "I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]", "[runs down to parking lot, sighs]", "Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.", "You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right.

[all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.", "No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.", "You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!", "Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?", "Get back to work, Dwight. Please.", "Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level.

[high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.", "Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.", "Oh!", "That's fun.", "All right.", "We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F.

This is the real world. Not The Real World[/b]: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird.

I said it on the second date.", "Yeah, she does all that.", "No, no...", "Run what?", "Why didn't you just say that, Pam?", "Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.", "Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.", "That's what makes it so wrong.", "Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.", "[whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.", "This is you. How much do you charge?", "I'll give you $50. Money's no object.", "Okay.", "It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.", "It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.", "I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.", "Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.", "It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.", "God, this is so disgusting.", "I know.", "That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.", "Helene?", "Oh.", "Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.", "[sighs] All right. [calls Dwight]", "You're back. What happened?", "No, what happened with Donna?", "Ugh!", "No. No! Are you sure?", "Who eats eight protein bars?", "Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.", "What? No, she didn't say that.", "I am not paying for that membership.", "[sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...", "No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?", "That's her?", "Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.", "I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.", "Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.", "If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.", "Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]", "...poop my pants.", "Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?", "We are?", "Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.", "Hey.", "Well it can wait. It can wait.", "Jim is her husband.", "And they are having problems, so sh...", "Good in bed.", "Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?", "Okay, weirdo.", "Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?", "Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?", "God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?", "I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.", "I have to hear it from her.", "I need to have her tell me herself. Right?", "I need to have her say...", "I need to say, \"What the hell is that? What the hell is that?\"", "No, God! No, no, oh, my God!", "[calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.", "You know what? We should really do something fun this week.", "Wouldn't that be fun?", "How about Thursday?", "I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?", "Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.", "Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.", "Nope, that's Tuesday.", "You're cheating. You're cheating on me.", "Pam told me.

Who's the guy? Who is it?", "I'm the mistress?", "Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]", "Pfffffttt.", "You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?", "You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.", "Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.", "Okay, alright.", "I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.", "Okay geniuses, how would you do it?", "I don't know.", "Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.", "[shouting] Toby, just do it! God!", "Good work. [clapping]", "[walks in] Morning everyone.", "Hello!", "Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]", "Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?", "Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.", "No, I gotta go. Text me later.", "Hey.", "Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.", "That... exists?", "Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.", "Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.", "Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?", "I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.", "Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.", "People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.", "I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.", "He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out.

Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.", "Real sports with Bryant Gumble.", "You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.", "Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.", "Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.", "I am Beyonce always.", "Yes, I am.", "I would love that.", "I have work to do.", "Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.", "All right, Andy, please.", "Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.", "Right there. The coach!", "Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?", "All right.

And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision.

Was she cute?", "Oh, god, Darryl!", "I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it.

You know, let's just...", "Okay. You can count on me.", "Hey Jo.", "I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus?

Is that close enough for you?", "No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.", "Luke is my nephew.", "Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.", "Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense.

No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?", "Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism.

And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.", "Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!", "Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!", "All right, those might be his.

I guess I never thought about it that way, though.", "Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.", "I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.", "I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place.

You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?", "Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?", "I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic. [Stanley stands to leave] See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?", "Oh, my god!", "You know what this is? This is a stinger.", "Like the movie.", "Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers.", "Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.", "Yes.", "Oh, no, no. No. Don't-", "Testify.", "Yeah, he is that good-looking.", "Okay.", "Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.", "Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.", "Stay-", "Oh!", "Don't let us down.", "No, no, no....", "I'm goin 'in!", "Stop, stop! Oh, my god! [enters office] Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.", "I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-", "Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.", "I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.", "A surveillance room next to this one.", "Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.", "Well-", "Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.", "No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.", "You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. [closes door] You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.", "So, you will?", "Hold it, hold it. [forcing door closed] Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?", "Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?", "I know, I know.", "Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?", "I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?", "Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!", "O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?", "No. No. No. Somebody in this office.", "No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.", "Yes.", "No, you may not.", "I said no.", "We're not-", "Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don't leave. Don't let him.", "Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?", "Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.", "No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.", "He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.", "Good-bye!", "This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.", "[standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat.

No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?", "So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?", "Blackula!", "Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.", "Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.", "Really? We're good?", "Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl's hand] Okay.", "Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.", "Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.", "Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?", "Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.", "You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!", "Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.", "This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.", "I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...", "And we are going to straighten this out.", "Mmhm!", "I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.", "No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.", "What is taking someone from behind?", "It was a good idea, though.", "[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?", "Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?", "Oh, you're sorry?", "What did you just thought?", "All right.", "Okay.", "Well, don't let it happen again.", "I-", "Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.", "You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.", "Okay, that might help. If you said \"I'm sorry\" in front of everybody.", "In front of me.", "So that's it.", "Is it?", "Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!", "Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.", "What's a bad idea?", "NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl.

You moved it.", "Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?", "If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?", "Thank you.", "If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!", "That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?", "Oh...", "Well...", "Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.", "You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.", "I am not budging on the hat issue.", "Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.", "Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.", "Sorry I was a jerk.", "Friends fight.

[misses and picks it up again] Flippity flip! [misses again and grabs it back] Flippity flip! [makes it in, gets excited] Really? [composes himself] Okay, see ya guys! [walks away, containing his self-pleasure]", "Kevin?", "Ahhhh...", "Maybe neither.", "Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.", "N-", "Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]", "Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?", "Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.", "Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]", "So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]", "[in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]", "You should see the other guy.", "[looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam?", "But it is already three o'clock! [Michael leaves, Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]", "[in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.", "Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.", "[Gabe is still standing in front of Michael's desk] And you, why are you still here.", "No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]", "[standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]", "What is this meeting about?", "Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. [Jim looks regretful] And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.", "[cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!", "Umm, hmm?", "[the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!", "Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out!", "[sad] Ohh...", "[holding back tears] Okay...", "Maybe.", "Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?", "[pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...", "Oh, okay.", "[hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.", "Alright.", "I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?", "I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.", "Okay... [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.", "No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]", "Later guys. [leaves the office]", "Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?", "[putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]", "That's what she said.", "[crying] I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream."], "Jim": ["Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...", "Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.", "My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.", "Whassup! I still love that after seven years.", "Nothing.", "All right. Take care.", "Yes?", "Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.", "Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?", "What are you doing?", "It's not on your desk.", "Why not?", "[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.", "If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.", "How do you know it was me?", "OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.", "Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?", "That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.", "Tonight, hopefully.", "What's going on?", "You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.", "Yeah, yeah.", "Um... What's in the bag?", "No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.", "Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]", "Hey.", "How are things?", "Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?", "Good. Good.", "That's great", "Yeah?", "Am I walking out?", "Yes, I... Do you want to...", "Great. Let me just...", "[Car horn honking] Oh, Roy.", "Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.", "That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, \"100% post-consumer content.\" What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.", "Do you really have to do that right now?", "Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.", "That is not the expression.", "This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?", "Solitaire?", "Six on seven.", "So then, why didn't you do it?", "Who doesn't love that?", "Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.", "You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.", "Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.", "[/b]: Uh, is that it?", "Hello? Hello?", "What are you watching?", "Really?", "No way. I think she likes this stuff.", "Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...", "Oh, yeah. She's hot.", "[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.", "[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.", "Hey.", "We can go.", "That's fine.", "Uh... Not a bad day.", "Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?", "Interesting, what's that like?", "Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...", "Gosh.", "That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.", "Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?", "Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.", "Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.", "It says \"workspace\".", "If it's the same thing, then why did you write \"workspace\"?", "You are not my superior.", "I thought it was a workspace?", "You cut more than you had to, didn't you?", "Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?", "OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.", "OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.", "Workspace.", "Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.", "Oh, great.", "I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.", "Thank you.", "What are you talking about?", "OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?", "Absolutely not.", "No I didn't.", "Killer nanorobots?", "Sounds tough.", "Do you?", "Mmm hmm.", "Yep.", "Good luck. [closes door and locks it]", "[answering phone] Jim Halpert.", "Who is this?", "No, you can't fire me.", "OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.", "Hey Pam! How are you?", "I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?", "No, not at all.", "I have nothing to do.", "Oh yeah?", "The mall?", "Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?", "Absolutely, I do.", "At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.", "To what?", "And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says \"No, Jim, here's a way.\"", "Oh yeah.", "I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.", "Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.", "What? No.", "What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.", "Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?", "But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.", "All right.", "Yeah, what do you think that's about?", "I'm on it.", "You are not going to believe this.", "Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.", "Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?", "Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...", "Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.", "Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...", "I love their sandwiches too.", "Their bread is very good.", "OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.", "Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.", "Sure, what's up?", "Oh no?", "No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.", "That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.", "OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.", "I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.", "What? What?", "[gives Dwight a high five] Great.", "Good.", "Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.", "I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.", "Thank you, thank you. OK.", "So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?", "Right... That's good.", "Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.", "Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?", "Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.", "OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.", "OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.", "But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.", "If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...", "No, no, dude, no.", "No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.", "God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...", "It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.", "God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?", "Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.", "That's him.", "Uh, I heard it.", "Oh my God.", "I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...", "Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.", "You coming down?", "You gonna wish me luck?", "Whoa.", "Is that trash talk from Pam?", "Oh.", "Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.", "I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.", "Have a good game man.", "Really? I thought I'd take Roy.", "My bad.", "You know what? Let me take Roy.", "Take it easy.", "[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.", "I didn't sign anything.", "Cute, sure, yeah.", "She's not really my type.", "Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.", "[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.", "Too late, Kev.", "Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.", "She'd be perfect for you.", "So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.", "Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.", "Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.", "It's all gold.", "Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.", "You buy a purse.", "Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?", "Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them.", "Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.", "No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.", "Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.", "[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?", "Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.", "Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.", "I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much?", "[whispering] Here he comes, shhh...", "[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.", "He did pick a good one.", "A futon?", "He's a grown man", "That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]", "Hi.", "I'm Jim, by the way.", "Hi Katy, nice to meet you.", "I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.", "Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.", "Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...", "What's up?", "Thank you for choosing me.", "Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.", "Yeah.", "Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.", "And stuff... yeah.", "What are you doing?", "Okay.", "That's cool.", "That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?", "Okay.", "Alright.", "Goodnight, Michael.", "I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?", "I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]", "I got it.", "Have a good night.", "Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.", "Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?", "This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.", "You're not going to freak out?", "My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless. They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.", "Freecell.", "Well, I mean.", "Um, what's going on here?", "Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]", "Yes, yes.", "How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...", "Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]", "Go get 'em.", "Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?", "I think she wasn't wearing a card.", "Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. \"Dwight's Workspace,\" nice.", "Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. \"Schrute Space,\" very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. \"Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,\" it's good.", "I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, \"Dwight Schrute Privates.\" Tough to say.", "Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.", "Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?", "Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.", "Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.", "Um...", "You're a jackass.", "No. Was that the hard way?", "Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?", "Right.", "Okay.", "Wait, slow down.", "One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.", "No thanks.", "No one wants to be you, Dwight.", "Is your password Frodo?", "Did you just change it to Gollum?", "[looks in the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?", "It was not rotting.", "Stop. Dwight, stop.", "Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.", "Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]", "We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.", "Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.", "You don't want to arouse suspicion.", "Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]", "Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.", "I'm trying, yup.", "Great, thanks.", "Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.", "Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.", "Well, then keep it.", "[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]", "Oh, really?", "Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is \"Mambo #5.\" So...", "I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.", "Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.", "Went well?", "You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.", "Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.", "Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.", "Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]", "Hey, Dwight. I need your stapler.", "Oh, great thanks.", "So, you ready for the... the Dundies?", "What?", "Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.", "No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, \"world's longest engagement\", um, we're all expecting it, you know?", "Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.", "Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.", "Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?", "Oh!", "Oh.", "Yeah.", "[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.", "Second drink?", "[starts clapping] Yeah, alright Kev.", "Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.", "What a great year for the Dundies.", "We got to see Ping. [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]", "What?", "Okay.", "I don't know, what?", "Oh my God! You are so drunk!", "Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.", "He's a volunteer.", "Dwight come on, come-", "Whoa.", "Whoa.", "Whoa, careful, careful.", "No you don't.", "Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.", "Shoot.", "Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.", "Alright.", "Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.", "Hey.", "Um... I don't think so.", "Oh! There it is!", "Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'", "Well done.", "Topical.", "Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!", "Except pass that breathalyzer.", "I'm really excited to meet your Mom.", "Oh yeah?", "Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.", "Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?", "I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.", "No, thanks. I'm good.", "Does that include 'That's What She Said'?", "Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...", "[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]", "Mm-hmm.", "No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.", "Wind.", "Perfect. [misses]", "Oh.", "Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?", "[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?", "Wait a minute, what is this?", "What?", "Really?", "Oh my God!

Er?", "[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.", "Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.", "Hey.", "Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?", "Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies.", "Notify the athletes.", "Michael.", "Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.", "Nice.", "Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.", "These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one. [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo.

Dwight.", "Come on Dwight! Use words.", "Who goes to business school?", "He does?", "What?", "You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.", "Yeah.

Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.", "Um... it's in Maryland.", "Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will.

Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland.

Could you beat up Michael?", "Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so...", "Uh, how did you know they were black belts?", "Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?", "I can't. I just got a manicure.", "Just have Dwight punch you.", "You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?", "Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?", "Ok, he has to be stopped.

But still romantic.", "Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.", "Oh, come on, Pam. I-", "Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway.

I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party.

Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows. I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.", "Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.", "We can talk about that later.", "See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour. It's-", "This is my desk.", "My home office, this is it.", "Ok, sure. Will do.", "Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right.", "You know what?

Havin' fun?", "Chicken, hot dog, burger.", "There is soda inside.", "Oh by the way how's your side project going?", "Really?", "So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.", "I think I did a pretty good job.", "Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.", "Yeah?", "Well, there's a $20 limit, right?

Where did you get it?", "He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.", "There's a little more to it.", "What is Yankee Swap?", "I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.", "Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.", "Sure you don't want the teapot?", "Right.", "No. No. Definitely. It's ..", "Got to be kidding me.", "Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.", "I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?", "Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.", "Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?", "You don't even drink tea.", "To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.", "You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.", "But ..", "Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.", "I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.", "Hey.", "What's up, buddy?", "Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.", "Who, Steve?", "Oh, there it is. J1.", "Here, you know what?

You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...", "Yeah, I know.", "Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.", "She's engaged.", "Huh.", "[off camera] Yeah, that's right.", "What?", "What's going on?", "I'm sorry? Pam.", "What is going on?", "Hey, whoa, Michael...", "It's, okay, it's Jim. Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.", "You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?", "Oh...", "But you said that you went out with her this weekend.", "[sounds of a car crash] What was that...", "Oh!", "He hit the pole!", "It's broken right, he can't...", "Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield] Ohhhhhh!", "He's still driving...

Cheese.", "We're going to the hospital, Michael.", "Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.", "Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight]", "Give the bottle to Michael!", "[to Michael] Will you stop?", "Michael stop.", "Michael stop.

How is this not a pyramid scheme?", "Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.", "Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?", "Oh, okay.", "Kelly, you know what...", "Sometime today.", "Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...", "So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.", "Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.", "[puts fabric softener into cart] ...What?", "Yeah, you don't?", "...Okay.", "Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.", "Just... quit stalling.", "Such a dork.", "How old are you?", "Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.", "You... owe me.", "Think you can let go?", "Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]", "Is that Michael?", "...It's something to think about.", "You look cute today, Dwight.", "So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot.

You are a volunteer.", "And that's not the same.", "[interrupting] Volunteer duty.", "Well, your office is behind you.", "I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.", "Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.", "Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?", "Now how do you know how it works?", "No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?", "Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me? [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]", "Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.", "Oh...", "[mouths] C'mon!", "[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]", "Hi.", "How much time do you have left on your break?", "Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?", "Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.", "Dwight tried to kiss me.", "And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.", "Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.", "Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.", "[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?", "You mean your thoughts and feelings?", "Yeah...", "Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.", "Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.", "This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.", "Oh.", "What did I write?", "[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.", "That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.", "Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.", "Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.", "Maybe Stanford would be cool.", "Yeah. Maybe we should both go.", "Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.", "No, Pam.", "Pam, it wasn't her.", "I'm the one who complained about you.", "I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.", "You know, it was one day.", "And I took it right back. It was like...", "[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye.

How long is the wait for a table for two?", "I can always kind of win at roulette.", "Yeah.", "Mind control.", "Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.", "It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter.

I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that.

I have no future here.", "[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.", "Yes.", "Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.", "Let's take a look. Nice.", "What?", "Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer.", "Wow. Oh!", "Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...", "No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.", "Kev!", "[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.", "It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.", "Yeah, right.", "What was this? [Makes face]", "Really?", "Wow. I think you're bluffing.", "Oh. Three nines.", "Thank you very much. It was fun.", "So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?", "No, thanks. You having fun?", "Yeah, we all really...", "Well, I think you look great.", "Yeah, why did you?", "Oh, yeah.", "No.", "Okay, will do.", "Hey, how's it going?", "Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?", "No, I...", "I was just... I'm in love with you.", "I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...", "I just needed you to know. Once.", "Yeah.", "Don't do that.", "Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be more than that.", "Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.", "Mmm-hmmm.", "He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.", "Well, you seem to have this under control.", "The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.", "Good one.", "What award would you like to give Dwight?", "Okay.", "Dwight, this is crazy.", "Dwight, Dwight.", "The other volunteers.", "What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.", "Hey.", "Yeah.", "Yeah?", "Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.", "Okay. [IM chiming] [laughing]", "Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...", "I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.", "I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?", "Okay, what?", "Okay.", "Nothing.", "What do you call it? Schruteball?", "Did you just come up with that?", "That is good. That's it. That's what it is.", "Wow. [cup tinkles]", "Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.", "Okay.", "Mmm-hmm.", "Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.", "Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?", "Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.", "Okay.", "Seventy and clear, that's nice. Where's that?", "Oh, the best.", "Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.", "Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.", "Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.", "Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.", "Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.", "Yeah.", "Kevin, do it.", "Groundhog Day.", "Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?", "And then you go to school for three years.", "Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?", "A semester?", "Wow.", "Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.", "What's up, Hef?", "What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?", "I don't know. He looks pretty scrappy.", "True. Meredith.", "Okay. Roy.", "Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?", "Hey.", "What are you doing?", "Really? Do you wanna get back to that? I could go. I should go.", "No, not at all.", "Uh hmm.", "Sure.", "[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere. Ooo, wait, last page, big finish. Here we go.

Umm. It was a couple of years ago. It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's. And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice. Umm, huh. And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else. So, best first date is also my worst first date. Oddly enough.", "Yes.", "Then why the question?", "I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.", "Really?", "You have a better idea?", "I'll use that.", "So, that's... It's great.", "Yeah. You have fun?", "Did you go to first base?", "Oh, yeah?", "Did you go to second?", "Second.", "Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?", "Pop-up?", "Really?", "So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second.

[laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.", "Which one?", "He can't hear you?", "I know.", "Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.", "What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow.

Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...", "Yeah.", "I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.", "You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.", "And doctors.", "I'm gonna pull the car around.", "Do you speak Spanish?", "No, I don't.", "Wow. Thanks.", "No, you what, seriously, you should have it.", "Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...", "What?", "Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos.

She'll call back!\"]", "I don't know.", "Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.", "Probably is.", "Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.", "That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.", "Maybe poison?", "My God!", "Not bad.", "What does Level Red mean?", "My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff.

Yep.", "You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.", "Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.", "That is a lot of liquor.", "And a dart board.", "Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.", "Yeah.", "All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.", "Oh yeah?", "Oh, tell him I say hi.", "Hey, how is... Toby?", "Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion.

Now we're friends.", "At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton.

Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.", "Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.", "Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?", "Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.", "Oh no, we're just sitting here.", "OK.", "And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.", "Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.", "Hey, Amy. How ya doing?", "[under his breath] Nice to meet you.", "Hey.", "Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?", "I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?", "Be honest.", "That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?", "For me, it was.", "Alright.", "Why don't we just go by ourselves?", "What about a gift basket full of cash?", "Yeah, he's definitely something.", "That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?", "I guess he can't get any girl he wants.", "Into a lake.", "I know. I love it there.", "Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.", "Sounds great.", "Yeee... (grunts in frustration)", "There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it.", "[to Pam] Wait for it.", "Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?", "Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well we all came, so...", "Haha...", "Uh-huh.", "MmmHmm...", "Oh yeah.", "Alright...", "Whoops. Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?", "Actually it sounds like you are.", "Or zipadeedoodaah.", "I was... mocking.", "Or a gong.", "Really? Power gel?", "What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?", "What?", "Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person.", "[dictating to Pam] Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.", "Sure we'll go.", "Oh I'm sorry. What?", "Nope.", "Definitely not. If anything it was a tie.", "How's it going?", "Yeah?", "You look a little worried.", "Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper.", "Hey man.", "What's going on?", "Oh yeah?", "I'm driving?", "Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.", "Yep. A long time ago, but, I liked it.", "Yeah.", "It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.", "What was that?", "Oh. Two kisses.", "Gotcha.", "That would be fun.", "Uhhh. Can't.", "Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?", "Mmmkay...", "Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.", "Yep.", "Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?", "Yep.", "Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.", "You need to let him go.", "Yes.", "Yes, but not by kidnapping.", "As a hostage.", "I think you're under-thinking it.", "Ransom.", "What did he say?", "So, we should let him go.", "Okay.", "Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.", "Hey, quick question. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?", "Okay.", "What have we got here?", "Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?", "Which one's this? Perfect.", "Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?", "And that's when I knew. You?", "That was the moment that you knew you liked me?", "Wow, can we make it a different moment?", "A toast, better make it good. To avoiding a class two felony charge.", "[talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.", "Hey Dwight.", "Do you run the bed and breakfest?", "Does the Department of Health know about this?", "Uh, Michael.", "That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.", "Darn it!", "No, can't.", "Where are you going out tonight?", "I wouldn't understand or a secret?", "I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.", "The Beets Motel? That is, wow.", "How are you doing this?", "Nice.", "Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.", "Not even Harry Potter?", "Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.", "Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.", "You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.", "[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?", "Hey Dwight.", "Does Mose have nightmares?", "Oh yes. Ever since the storm.", "Yeah, yeah.", "Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.", "Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]", "You okay?", "Are you a cocktail waitress?", "No, sometimes its right.", "Dwight, how's the hotel business?", "Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?", "Maybe you should.", "The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.", "You will never want to leave your room.", "Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?", "Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam.", "Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.", "Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.", "Yeah?", "Okay.", "Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.", "Nobody tell him!", "You got it, you're so close!", "Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...", "Nope.", "I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.", "You playing that game again?", "Oh it has losers.", "Who are you talking to, specifically?", "Hey.", "Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.", "Yeah.", "[sighs]", "Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.", "Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---", "Yep.", "I... why don't we go back to this animation.", "Ah, show me how this works.", "I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.", "Okay. Do you want me to stay?", "Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.", "I, ah...", "Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.", "You're welcome.", "Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?", "Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.", "Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]", "I just thought you should---", "Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam]", "Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.", "So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?", "Oscar?", "So what are you going to do?", "Did they?", "We just passed the exit for Corcroan.", "What are we doing?", "We're going to Utica?", "I'm not going to Utica right now.", "No.", "I can't believe you guys. I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.", "No, I'm not calling Karen.", "What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!", "Are you kidding me?", "Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...", "Okay.", "You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here.", "Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing?", "Oh, God. [hangs up phone]", "No.", "No, no absolutely we are not doing this.", "Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?", "So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache.", "What?", "Okay, you know what?", "Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?", "It doesn't matter.", "Doesn't matter.", "That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.", "Oh my God!", "Michael, watch the road!", "Michael! Michael, pull over!", "Pull over, pull over!", "I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.", "No, Michael. I'm not leaving the car.", "Guy's going by. Shh.", "No, no, you won't do that. Nope.", "Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?", "Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.", "Shut up, you, shut up! This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.", "Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.", "No, no, don't do anything to them.", "Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.", "Isn't that thing huge?", "No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.", "Okay! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all-", "Damn it guys!", "Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!", "No, I'm not doing that.", "No, I'm not doing that!", "Hey Karen.", "First of all, hi.", "You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...", "Copy that.", "Yes?", "Yeah, trying to quit though.", "Oh no, I didn't want to see you. Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier. Equal, I'd say it was equal. So, good to see you...", "I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...", "[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome. I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.", "I... will... [gives up and walks away]", "Hey.", "Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?", "[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.", "Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was uh, a fun read.", "Mm-hmm.", "Yeah.", "No, that wasn't fun.", "Of course I read it.", "Angela. Nope. The ashes.", "Got it.", "Absolutely, yes.", "When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.", "Yeah?", "And I am always busy.", "Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.", "Is there a limit?", "Well, is that it? Or?", "How so?", "What's that?", "Right.", "Not gonna change.", "I thought we had that looked at.", "Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?", "OK, great.", "Yup.", "That'd be great.", "Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?", "I do remember, yeah.", "You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?", "There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.", "And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to \"Happy Birthday.\" And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.", "So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.", "We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.", "It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?", "No... I think it's a great idea.", "You know, try sending them another invoice.", "Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?", "Right? I was just thinking...", "Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]", "What's that?", "Oh, sure.", "OK. [Meredith leaves]", "Yeah, people like me I guess.", "Well I think Meredith was just --", "Everybody's birthday.", "What do you want?", "You want a birthday pie?", "Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.", "It will be Angela.", "Andy.", "Not your birthday.", "Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.", "Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.", "Alright. [Andy rolls back]", "OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.", "Hey guys, what're we talking about?", "Toby.", "Oh, thanks man.", "Is there anything --", "Oh, OK.", "What?", "I remember that.", "Seriously?", "Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.", "OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?", "That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please? 'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.", "Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.", "Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.", "Hey.", "Sure glad you're back.", "You have no idea.", "Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.", "So, terrible idea.", "You did do it?", "Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.", "That's what who said?", "That's what she said.", "All right, let's run it back.", "Sure.", "Wow.", "Oh, I can't beat Darryl.", "What, seriously? What is she saying?", "So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?", "Bring me players.", "Good game Meredith.", "Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?", "[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?", "Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...", "I think I'm ready.", "...Right. Spin-serve! [serves, and Dwight scores]", "Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?", "Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.", "I think you did.", "Oh, I-", "Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.", "Hi.", "Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?", "I have been getting ready and then driving over here.", "Really?", "Tour, let's do the tour first.", "Oh, you guys doing a little construction?", "It's fire.", "Just like that.", "Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.", "Wow.", "What is that chestnut?", "Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.", "Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.", "What was that?", "Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]", "You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.", "That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.", "I don't know because I everything I own is there.", "Katie Holmes.", "Oh, Dawson's Creek.", "Not really a rhyme.", "Tom Cruise!", "Oh no she just put it in front of my face.", "I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?", "[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?", "Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...", "Nevermind.", "That's nice.", "It's getting late.", "[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course", "Oh... my apartment's on fire", "Flooded.", "You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.", "[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.", "So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.", "Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.", "Oh, you don't know her.", "Your mom.", "Michael, you didn't even know her.", "[walks up to reception] Margaret?", "You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]", "Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.", "OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs]", "Have I not proposed to you, yet?", "Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles]", "No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.", "Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.", "Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.", "And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.", "I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.", "Nice. [fist bumps Kevin]", "Where do you want to go for dinner?", "Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?", "What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.", "No, no, no.", "How'd you get gum in your hair?", "But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.", "Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.", "Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?", "Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.", "Thanks.", "Did I? I don't...", "Hmm.", "Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.", "And then an older gentleman asked you \"Boxers or briefs?\"", "What?", "I'm gonna go to my desk.", "I know.", "I can't.", "I'm not single.", "Pam.", "You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.", "So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.", "Thanks a lot guys, Good job.", "Nice job everybody. Great work.", "Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.", "You really don't have his phone number?", "Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...", "It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.", "It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...", "No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?", "Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?", "[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out.

Is that you?", "Still haven't left the house yet, huh?", "Good. Please hurry.", "Will do. [hangs up] I'll stop calling.", "[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.", "I... just... if they speak Spanish.", "Lucky us.", "Yeah that's true.", "If you were a real star you would put your face in it.", "We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.", "Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...", "Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...", "And in this case...", "That's also not true.", "You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...", "Would...", "Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.", "What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?", "An urban thing...", "Oh boy...", "On a wing and a prayer, mostly.", "A formal warning... [chuckles]", "[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.", "I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...", "Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...", "Yeah...", "That's not a good idea.", "Who?", "Let's go.", "Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.", "Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.", "Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.", "Great!", "Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?", "Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-", "Absolutely, will do.", "So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.", "You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.", "Yep. [Maguire keeps swinging]", "Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?", "Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.", "Oh, I like you.", "Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?", "Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?", "Absolutely.", "You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.", "I closed it!", "Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]", "[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.", "Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...", "And how many would you like?", "Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.", "Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.", "[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.", "Yes it is.", "Oh, thank you. I've been working out.", "Can't do that. Unsanitary.", "[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.", "Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.", "Oh, hello Mater. Good news[/b]: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.", "Hey... What?", "No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!", "Yes! So when do you start?", "Wow. Busy morning.", "It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.", "See how easy that is?", "[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.", "Thanks.", "I just-", "No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...", "All right, well it already went through, so...", "Hello?", "That's not it.", "Yeah.", "Close.", "Mmhmm.", "What are the two levels?", "Mmhmm.", "Okay. Let's start with the \"I love you\" level.", "Yes. You don't love Holly.", "But you just met her.", "Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.", "Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.", "Yeah.", "We've been through this.", "Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.", "Well, we're really happy.", "And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.", "I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.", "I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?", "Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.", "Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]", "Well we all want a good party, right?", "I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!", "[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]", "What'd you do?", "Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?", "Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.", "There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!", "Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?", "[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]", "Yeah, who'd have thought?

That's great.", "I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?", "Definitely not.", "Conference room?", "That was slightly harsh, don't you think?", "You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?", "As opposed to...", "What about cars?", "They do? So, cars are flightless airplanes.", "Got it. They're like the penguins of the airplane family.", "Thanks.", "Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.", "How long have you been a man?", "That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.", "Right back at ya.", "Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.", "Pam! You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you?

[sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...", "Yup.", "Right.", "Mmmhmm. Why don't you start by telling me what you got.", "Love it.", "Mm, can't do that.", "Definitely can't do that.", "You know what?", "Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.", "I'm just doing my job, man.", "Good! Fine! I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]", "What? What?", "What?", "Okay, make a commercial.", "Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]", "Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative. Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known. Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.", "Well, you're driving, right?", "Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.", "Nnnno. Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire. But I think I fixed it.", "I have to. Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail. Or die.", "Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.", "Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.", "All right, I'm gonna go now.", "Okay, I will. [idiot voice]", "You embarrassed me.", "How much time do I have?", "So, where did you learn how to play?", "My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?", "What are you doing?", "Right. There, first...", "I think that's the question that you had...", "Wow. [heads toward the conference room]", "All right.", "What are you guys doing?", "Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last? [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]", "Good eye - it's an oval. [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.", "Do you?", "Yup.", "Now, wait a minute. You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?", "We should probably get back.", "I didn't have anything, Jan.", "I'm sorry. She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]", "What's that?", "I actually know a s*x model.", "Yep. Yeah. She's blind, is that a problem?", "Okay.", "Yes.", "Oh, yeah.", "Will do. [hangs up] I'll stop calling. [walks into lobby]", "No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.", "Well, he'll be here really soon, Kev.", "Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam] Shared responsibility.", "Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.", "Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.", "Who else is he mean to?", "Mm-hmm.", "Hey.", "She's never worn these glasses before.", "Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him. And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.", "A formal warning, seriously?", "And no one cared.", "Productivity? My numbers are good.", "If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's. And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.

Uh, we're friends. But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily. I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.", "Scared me.

[Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.", "Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.

I don't know. I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago? Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard. And it's not even a good beard.", "Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor? Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages? That'd be great.", "Why wouldn't you see him? You work for him.", "Okay, what's going on?", "[smiles, looks to Michael][/b] Really, nothing?", "Ah, they moved the shower.", "No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?", "Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.", "But what have you learned about her?", "Nice.", "Well, I tried. [Michael laughs]", "I'll just go later.", "So you have the directions.", "You have a toothbrush.", "You have a cell phone charger.", "Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.", "What happened?", "Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]", "Bye.", "Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...", "I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.", "I don't really know Ronnie.

[shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?", "But he did, right?", "All right.", "Nope.", "Mmm.", "How much weight have you lost, Dwight?", "No, you're definitely the problem.", "Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually. But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.", "Fair question.", "See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.", "Summers going great. Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump. I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.

I suck.", "Dwight says \"Hi.\"", "Now he is saying \"Hi\" louder.", "Umm...", "Hey, can you go to IM?", "OK.", "I'm gonna write you up for not working.", "[holds up an ASCII image of Dwight]", "Hey, Michael. I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.", "Perfect.", "[Jim gets down on one knee]", "I just... couldn't wait.", "Pam, will you marry me?", "So?", "Hey, sorry everybody.", "Hey Dwight.", "What's up, Meredith?", "Alright. I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.", "Why, what happened?", "Ah. That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.", "I just didn't, you know, want a deal.", "OK. You know what? Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody? I just want to make an announcement. Pam and I are engaged.", "Nope.", "Thank you Angela.", "Yes.", "To get married.", "Yep.

Seventeen seconds.", "[stops the watch] One second.", "Hey, Andy.", "By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?", "Actually not. It was really so-so.", "I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff. You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?", "You know, it's weird. It's practically a shot for shot remake.", "Story's kinda bland. It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.", "He has not stopped working for a second. At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible. At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports. And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work. It's exhausting, being this vigilant. I'll probably have to go home early today.", "[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.

Right, that style.", "OK...", "Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?", "OK.", "[clearly just humoring her] No... way!", "Ha ha. That's hilarious?", "Who, Stacy?", "Uh...", "OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later.

OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.", "[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message.", "[walking to his car] Hey, it's me. It is 5:03.", "You must be out or something.", "Is it me, or are we just a little off today?", "Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.", "Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?", "Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe.", "Wish you were home. Uh, anyway...", "I miss you.", "We were robbed last night.", "So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.", "I'm on minute six of this message.", "The future mother of my children.", "Do you need us for any of this?", "5 dollars.", "I can see that.", "Another round, boys?

I can never tell with those two.", "Hey, how are you?", "Good to see you.", "All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.", "That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.", "Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?", "Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.", "That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?", "Love that one.", "Here you go again! What is your deal today?", "One.", "Half.", "Also good.", "Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?", "Pam, don't worry about it.", "Guys, what is going on?! [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]", "Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?", "That is good.", "Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank.

Welcome to the family.\"", "Yeah, we'd never do that.", "You wouldn't tell your mom?", "Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.", "Aww.", "[on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.", "Nope.", "You must be really proud.", "Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.", "OK.

He seems upset about something.", "It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.", "How was your meeting with Michael?", "Was it your scores?", "Mm-hmm.", "Of course.", "Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.", "There's the charm.", "That is me. Wish me luck.", "Thanks.", "I love you, too.", "I'm not talking to you.", "What?", "Did my scores drop a little?", "Are we even sure that's my file?", "Well, there's got to be an explanation.", "Yeah.", "I think you mean smug", "Michael, I'm just trying to --", "I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire.

That's private.", "Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.", "You're gonna have to talk louder.", "Son, you have to talk louder.", "Louder, son!", "Now, you listen to me, sir.", "The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.", "I'm irate right now.", "Well, I should hope so.

Sorry about Dwight, by the way.", "Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...", "Hey, how are you and Darryl?", "Bye.", "What was?", "No, actually.", "I don't think so.", "Hey, how's things?", "Yeah?", "Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?", "Wait, that's pretty weird.", "Well, Andy has a mug just like that.", "No. What party?", "I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?", "Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]", "[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]", "Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.", "Is that it?", "OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing[/b]: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.", "Probably just Kelly.", "That's what I'm saying.", "You were right.", "You were right.", "You knew it.", "You knew it the whole time, buddy.", "Wow.", "No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.", "We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.", "Who's that?", "Oh, that's gonna be great.

He is into you.", "Don't.", "Why are you telling us this?", "Where are you going?", "Where is it?", "Okay.", "Six point five days.

And weird.", "[in office] Are you sure?", "Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.", "Okay, okay, it's no big deal. So you're not a computer geek.", "[looks shocked] W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.", "It's not--- It's not about me. I mean, this your dream.", "And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?", "[concerned look on face] You okay?", "Okay.", "Alright.", "Love you too.

See if he's, see if he's back.", "Yeah, I am. Wait, how do you know that? I didn't tell you that.", "That's really not cool.", "Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.", "Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting] She's gonna love it. Right?", "Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?", "Oh thanks, Phyllis.", "Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave? By the quarry?", "Definitely we should.", "Mmhmm, yeah.", "Oh totally. Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?", "No.", "[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.", "Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...", "[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?", "Cool.", "I have a surprise for you. All right, ready? Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes. Tadah!", "I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside. [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall] Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood. [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]", "[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage. It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.

And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---", "You do?", "Really?", "Oh my God...", "Yeah, I did. [they kiss]", "No, No, we'll just board that up.

So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.", "You have to make the decision.", "Hey.", "Mmhmm.", "Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.", "Yeah.", "Beesly, are you threatening me?", "Okay.", "[shudders] Whew.", "Woah, you guys going to lunch?", "Mind if I join?", "All right.", "Let's go.", "Let's do it.", "Where we going?", "Michael, that is hilarious.", "Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.", "Yeah.", "You look really pretty.", "[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.", "Yeah?", "There they are.", "You got it.", "Okay.", "Oh!", "[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.", "Let me call you right back. Okay.", "Wait, what?", "Truce?", "Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]", "Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.", "Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping.", "I think it'll take you a little longer than that.", "Ah. You brought in your doll collection.", "That's the Christmas spirit.", "Yes.", "I will grant you one wish.", "Stupid. Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes.

People are having a Christmas party.", "You did not know it.", "Everyone knew some of it.", "You knew it.", "She knew it.", "No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.", "[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.", "Nothing.", "Why don't... Let's...", "How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...", "Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office]", "No, no.", "I know.", "Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.", "We can't figure that out.", "No.", "Please stop.", "When?", "This is really not how this is supposed to happen.", "Stop. What?", "Okay, listen.", "This shouldn't happen at work.", "And!", "This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.", "Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.", "But you're leaving...", "[to Dwight] What are you standing for?", "You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.", "Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...", "You okay, man?", "Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?", "Nope.", "Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...", "Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.", "So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.", "[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]", "Thanks Meredith.", "Dwight! Are your legs broken?", "Andy, are you all right?", "Looks like a red wire.", "Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.", "Doesn't it?", "Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore.

Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.", "[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand.

Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?", "That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.", "That's exactly what Wallace told us.", "I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.", "Hey, David. You got Jim here.", "Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.", "David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.", "Nope, not at all.", "Alright, thanks alot, David.", "You don't have to lie.", "Right.", "Alright. Let's get started.", "Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?", "Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.", "It's hard to tell so far.", "I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?", "You just came up with that.", "Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.", "Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.", "Pro-- no favoritism.", "I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.", "You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.", "I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...", "I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.", "Michael.", "Look, you have a lot of strengths.", "I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.", "But there is a reason why I'm here!", "No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!", "I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!", "At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.", "But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.", "[leave the conference room to address everyone]", "Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.", "Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.", "Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.", "Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.", "Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--", "Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]", "Thank you, Meredith.", "Rank each person individually?", "[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]", "Nope. I'm numbering the paper.", "[to camera] It's going really well, actually.", "[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]", "He's not a part of this. You know that.", "Okay, your move.", "Here we go.", "Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.", "I was just trying to be unbiased.", "Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.", "Six. You?", "I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?", "We tried to find the fairest way to do it.", "I just-- what?", "[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?", "[Michael give Jim a \"World's Best Boss\" mug] Thank you.", "What's in here?", "Ooh!", "We would really appreciate it.", "It is really special.", "Well, congrats.", "Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.", "No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.", "Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.", "That's nice.", "Good-bye.", "Yeah?", "Oh, wow. That's cool.", "[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.", "Lousy Picture.", "Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.", "And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.", "I know. We're pretty excited, too.", "I don't like that.", "Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?", "Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.", "Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.", "Pretty sure everyone heard that.", "Mr. Beesly. How are ya?", "Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?", "No.", "Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.", "Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?", "I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So... I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--", "Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.", "Michael.", "Oh, my God. Please.", "Alright.", "To waiting.", "I can't believe it was me.", "Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?", "I'm so sorry.", "Oh, my God. Are you serious?", "[over phone] What?", "[over phone] What?", "[over phone] What?", "Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.", "Uh...", "[over phone] And Dwight.", "Pam, it just happened.", "I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!", "No. Let's talk for a long time.", "That's not how that works.", "I may have told some people that. I'm nervous. I'm about to get married.", "[answers cell phone] Hey!", "Is this allowed?", "Wow. You look--", "So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry. Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--", "[takes her hand] Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you're so pretty.", "And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right?", "There. Now we're even. [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]", "Well we are here now, so let's just--", "You look great.", "I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her.", "Hello?", "Oscar! Uh, what is going on?", "Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-", "Hello?", "Michael?", "How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.", "That sounds bad.", "I'm gonna help you through it all right?", "All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and- it- and then go to--", "And then you'll be saved.", "Just [drops] and then you'll be saved.", "A- ah--", "And you'll be saved.", "I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An- M- please don't call again.", "It was.", "Really was.", "Puerto Rico was awesome.", "[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.", "Nope.", "Do we have a conversation scheduled?", "Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.", "It's a real handsome duck.", "Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?", "What?", "You're messing with me.", "You did not have s*x with Pam's mom.", "What kind of car does she drive?", "[expletive]", "Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.", "Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-", "Oh my God.", "Not now, Toby, my God!", "Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.", "No, not more than anything.", "Don't call her \"the mom.\"", "Then take a different way home, man!", "Okay, so we're good.", "Frank and beans!", "You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?", "You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.", "No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]", "Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.", "Yes, you do.", "Just take the parrot.", "Okay, back to the old grind.", "Don't-", "Sounds complicated.", "[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?", "[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.", "Andy, can I talk to you for a second?", "[holding up a sign that reads, \"Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office\"]", "I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?", "Really?", "I was gonna go with this one.", "And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice. [everyone claps and makes comments]", "Yes! Angela! Please...", "Yes! I think we should look into that. If you could just speak up louder...", "Yes.", "Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good!", "Barely, I... I don't have all the facts. Frank and Bean...", "[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...", "Yep...", "[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.", "[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.", "A wooden duck?", "Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...", "Silence.", "I won't. But, you will wash and buff our car.", "[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second? So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day. So he generously offered to wash our car.", "Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.", "[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?", "Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!", "Yeah... maybe.", "You're not, nope. Nope.", "We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.", "Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.", "Wow.", "I bet we would.", "Cool.", "Mmm-hmm.", "Who doesn't?", "Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.", "That is a mistake.", "Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?", "Great. See ya' then.", "They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.", "I absolutely don't understand, either.", "Alright.", "Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?", "Dave.", "Dave.", "Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.", "Yes, it is.", "No thanks.", "Mmm-hmm.", "...and paper.", "Nope. No.", "He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.", "I outran it.", "I'll just leave that suit in your office then.", "Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.", "Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.", "Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.", "I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.", "No, they don't.", "Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.", "Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.", "See?", "Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...", "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.", "What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?", "That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...", "Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.", "What are you doing?", "No.", "See what?", "Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.", "Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.", "It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?", "I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]", "I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.", "[laughing] He's alright.", "Thanks Michael.", "Oh man, that's crazy. Right as we were on our way out too.", "Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them.", "That's okay.", "It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello? Well that's great. [hangs up phone] Turns out the paper was there all along.", "Pam's sales are fine actually.", "Wow.", "Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]", "Definitely Grandma.", "Penny for your thoughts.", "Wow.", "[whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein.", "You set the bar so high.", "Okay, so--", "Stop.", "Hey.", "Inappropriate.", "All the time.", "Yeah.", "She wants it bad Michael.", "I can.", "And I don't support her choice to hit you.", "But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.", "I just need some time.", "I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.", "No more than a week. Maybe two weeks.", "Feel better?", "Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.", "OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.", "OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.", "So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?", "And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.", "Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.", "You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.", "Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]", "[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing] We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.", "Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine. So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.", "That's it.", "That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?", "Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room] Here's the deal guys. There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.", "Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good.", "Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.", "OK, great.", "Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.", "I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.", "Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.", "And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?", "OK, I'm going back to work.", "OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.", "Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.", "[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets. Do you want to-", "No, you're not reopening the case. The case is closed.", "Or maybe he's just stuck in character.", "Both. They're both worse.", "It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out. We're not going under.", "Michael, not now.", "Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.", "Michael, can I talk to you in your office?", "Caleb!", "Today of all days...", "I'll take it.", "Hey David.", "Oh, OK.", "Sure. Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-", "OK.", "See ya.", "Nothing yet.", "Well there is some bad news. [accent] There has been another murder.", "Conference room everyone.", "No.", "I think today was a good day to have two managers. 'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing. But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy. It's because they're doing it for the kids. And I get that now.", "Andy revealed himself to be a double agent. At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent. And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent. Oh, and it is 6:00.", "[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in] Really?", "Yeah, I want to go home.", "Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.", "The next year he really stepped things up.", "A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.", "Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.", "I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.", "Mmm.", "God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]", "Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?", "But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.", "Could go either way.", "Maybe we should just wait and find out.", "Ok.", "Nah. Might as well do it now.", "Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?", "Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.", "I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.", "Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?", "Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]", "Who here heard it from Ryan?", "Yes.", "I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment, is the only one who raises her hand]", "I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?", "To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.", "Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.", "Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.", "Hey, Ryan. How's it going?", "Mmm-hmm.", "Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.", "You know what?", "I think I know the problem.", "I think you seem distracted.", "But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.", "I am, too. Let me show you.", "I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.", "Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.", "Right.", "[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]", "Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?", "Wow, what do you put our chances at?", "Hmm, sounds risky.", "Wow, that's not such a bad idea.", "Anything else?", "Hey. What's up?", "Did you murder someone?", "I think she's okay.", "Great. Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?", "You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.", "It would look bad. Sorry.", "Not much.", "[laughs] Thanks Dwight.", "You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go.", "Let me guess, you think you should get it.", "Well, in an ideal world...", "Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away \"Survival Skills\" and \"Self-defense.\"", "That's okay, I'll do it.", "Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome. I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes. And the winner is, employee number nine. And that is?", "Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-", "Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.", "Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize.", "Dwight?", "No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money. But-", "Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it. Okay? This was your idea anyway.", "Okay.", "Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?", "Okay. That is me, but I didn't order the cake.", "This is Jim.", "Hey, uh David.", "So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today. It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.", "No.", "I really don't know how it happened, David.", "All right, it will not happen again. I promise.", "Yeah. Thank you.", "Yes.", "See you.", "See you tomorrow, Dwight.", "Too loud.", "Too, too loud. Too Loud.", "Yeah.", "This is all we have.", "No, it's not \"ugh.\" It is... office camaraderie.", "Why would you start so high?", "Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]", "No.", "We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.", "Pam!", "Yes.", "Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!", "Yeah.", "Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.", "No, I'm not gonna do that.", "I think she's doing a good job.", "I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.", "I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.", "That's what I want.", "What would Bob do?", "Hey hey hey. Everything okay?", "Can I just talk to you for a second?", "You can't yell out \"I need this, I need this\" as you pin down an employee on your lap!", "Yup.", "Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.", "Great!", "Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]", "And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand] Can I get you some punch?", "No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]", "Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.", "What?", "What?", "Wait wait wait, who said that?", "What?", "Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?", "Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.", "No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.", "Oh my God, David. That's horrible.", "Oh my God!", "Co-manager, actually.", "Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...", "Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.", "Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.", "Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.", "But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.", "[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video.

I don't know.", "I don't know, I don't know.", "Jerry.", "This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -", "No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.", "Do it.", "We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.", "What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?", "All right.", "There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.", "Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.", "What?", "Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.", "No.", "Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?", "Anybody could have walked in.", "Whoa, whoa.", "I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here[/b]: Michael handles more of the \"big-picture\" stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...", "Alright.", "No.", "I don't think so.", "I... Why would you just say something like that?", "Do you even know what that means?", "Um...", "This is way more than I make now.", "I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.", "Hey, you got a second?", "Actually, yeah.", "Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.", "Yeah!", "Really.", "No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.", "Why would you do that?", "Mm!", "[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.", "What is that?", "Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.", "Why would I wanna do that?", "For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...", "Yeah. Thank you.", "Hey.", "Well, the grass is always greener.", "Well, it's what you wanted.", "For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.", "Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.", "That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.", "Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.", "Alright.", "Yep.", "[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?

Oh, definitely.", "Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.", "Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.

Come on.", "Are you serious? Pam.", "I... Pam, please.", "Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.", "So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.", "Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.", "Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?", "You know, it's getting real crowded in here.

Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.", "Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry.", "Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.

Totally.", "I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy.

Well, all that is irrelevant.", "What?", "What was that?", "Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.", "Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.", "Uh, for that printer, yes.

Michael.", "Michael.", "No.", "What?", "Stop what?", "[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing.

That's... not... yours.", "Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee.

You were wrong.", "Well, A for effort right?", "Which is you.", "I disagree with.", "Okay, someone look it up.", "Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.", "Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?", "Oh wow, these are nice.", "Yeah, yeah. Totally.", "Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.", "Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.", "Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?", "No.", "He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?", "No politics?", "Two for two, keep it up.", "What do you know about boobs?", "Thank you.", "Show him how to use it.", "It's still on a bike path though right?", "What does that mean?", "What?", "But you didn't fail.", "And you didn't fail those things either.", "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.", "One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.", "You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?", "Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.", "Hey, it's snowing.", "[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]", "Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?", "You've got something on your nose.", "No.", "You got it.", "Hey.", "We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.", "Me neither. Whew.", "[A note is on Jim's computer that says, \"It is time. Parking lot at noon.\" Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]", "[standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone]", "Stop! Stop!", "Oh... oh!", "Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] \"How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.\"", "Okay... Holly's back.", "Aww...", "Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!", "Stop!", "Okay. Okay. Okay.", "Seriously!", "Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]", "I just want it to stop.", "Hey, Toby.", "No way.", "That's increadible.", "You know what's crazy?", "I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]", "What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.", "Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole \"Woody came to life\" thing so quickly?", "Yikes. [everyone gasps]", "No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.", "[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] \"Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.\" [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!", "Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]", "Ooh, go easy with the shaking.", "You like it?", "Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.", "Alright, my turn.", "Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] \"The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.\" Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.", "I mean... [speechless]", "I surrender.", "Anything. You got it.", "You're a psychopath.", "I don't want to go.", "Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]", "No, it's, it's okay. Okay.", "Okay. This is it.", "Go! Go! Go!", "Oh.", "I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.", "I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.", "Sounds good.", "Smart.", "Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.", "Was it?", "[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.", "Listen, this isn't a favor, all right? This is a good idea. We all win.", "Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.", "I know.", "I'm really sorry. I can't do it.", "Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?", "I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.", "Hey.", "[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.", "Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?", "Ohh! Good-bye.", "Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.", "I was blue group, so it was second from the top.", "Was in the green group.", "And that's what I told him.", "\"My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.\"", "Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.", "Hey.", "Pretty good.", "It has been, yeah.", "Sales.", "[laughs]", "Oh, man. You remember that, huh?", "All right, good catch-up.", "See ya.", "All right. Bye.", "Let's Go!", "He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.", "That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?", "Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.", "Where'd I put what?", "Oh, sorry gotta go.", "Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.", "Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.", "And the final clue...", "You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.", "Cheer up. We made a sale.", "Well, I'm going the speed limit. So...", "Someone's in a bad mood.", "Alright, let me turn on some music.", "No you don't.", "Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.", "Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.", "Hello?", "Hey Helen. Is everything ok?", "Ok...", "What?", "Oh my God.", "Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?", "Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.", "Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?", "Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.", "No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.", "Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.", "And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.", "Nope.", "Ok. Bye.", "[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.", "Big tip.", "What?", "We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.", "Shh.", "Um, bottomless champagne.", "No.", "[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]", "[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.", "Aww, nuts. [laughs]", "OOH! Boom! Face!", "Did it!", "Love it. Keep it goin.", "Mm-hmm.", "[snorts] Ew.", "Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.", "Definitely not. That's disgusting.", "Hey, you don't have to...", "That was really rough.", "No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.", "And a shower.", "What?", "No. We took a walk.", "Threat Level[/b]: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.", "Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!", "I did not love the dialogue. Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.", "[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.", "I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.", "[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!", "Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.", "Three months.", "Four months.", "Eight months?", "[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.", "Okay now really think hard about this one[/b]: One year.", "[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?", "Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...", "[to Michael] Why is Packer back?", "What!?", "You did approve it?", "[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?", "Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...", "Do I have any say in this?!", "Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?", "[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?", "Well, I mean he humped Michael.", "Yeah.", "[continues working]", "That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious]", "[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?", "So, this hot chocolate thing.", "Well, you know you can't actually poison him.", "I really think we should join forces on this one.", "What do we think, what would drive him crazy.", "Here we go.", "You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.", "Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.", "He... It's a crime fighting beaver.", "Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.", "Yeah I couldn't cut it down.", "One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?", "[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]", "It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!", "[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!", "[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]", "He's a jerk.", "Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]", "Oh, yikes.", "How did those get out? I'm sorry.", "I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.", "Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.", "Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.", "[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.", "They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]", "She's amazing. This is very exciting.", "That's a guarantee.", "Don't think you need the corpse then.", "At a gas station. [oscar laughs]", "Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.", "Totally reasonable.", "Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.", "Yeah... it.s scary.", "Not bad right. [swinging golf club]", "[to Dwight] Nice.", "Oh my God.", "It is right. I mean, it's impossible.", "They're probably worthless.", "Leave the telescope.", "Holly, will you marry me?", "Congratulations!", "Wait, what?", "[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.", "Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.", "Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.", "And what happens here is-", "We were... I think she was just trying to-", "Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?", "Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.", "Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?", "Thank you very much.", "We're back in! Right?", "Yep, okay...", "Okay.", "No she doesn't wa- She's not here.", "Stay in bed!", "Having a great time.", "Thanks, yeah.", "Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.", "[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.", "Who's gonna see us?", "Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]", "I think I'm gonna go.", "I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!", "I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.", "[shaking head at the camera]", "Nope, go back to the script.", "Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?", "I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!", "Didn't I?", "I gotta go do this.", "I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-", "That did. Pretty huge laugh.", "And impressions!", "You gotta play along man.", "So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?", "[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.", "You sure?", "Did you break the shredder Kevin?", "[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?", "Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.", "Hey, can I talk to you for a second?", "[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.", "What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?", "You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?", "Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.", "Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.", "You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.", "And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]", "Alright.", "Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...", "[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.", "[chuckles] You got it.", "Hey!", "No he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him.", "Every time there's a silence, your brain's like \"Heh-heh-huh-huh\" [imitating crying].", "Careful. There is no inner circle.", "There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.", "That's Toys R Us, I think.", "[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled \"administrative\" and \"assistant.\"", "Seriously?", "What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?", "He's good at his job. And I like working for him.", "And say what? \"Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?\"", "Mmm-hmm.", "Hey, you got a second?", "Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --", "If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --", "I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand] Just the guys. Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem. I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads.", "Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --", "Whoa. Whoa. Wait.", "Oh. Like nobody.", "It was --", "That's awesome.", "Hey, who'd you end up hiring?", "Oh yeah, did he text us?", "He didn't text me. [Andy's phone chimes]", "[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.", "Yeah.", "Nope. Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]", "Well, there is no inner...circle.", "So this is my life. Until I win the lottery [laughs]. Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.", "You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours.", "Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.", "Why not?", "Alright, there you go.", "15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?", "Okay.", "Fantastic.", "Yup.", "[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?", "Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please?", "Erin.", "All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]", "Nope. Baskets have it.", "So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.", "[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.", "Wait...", "I'm coming.", "You'd slow me down.", "Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.", "Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?", "You define foment.", "Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.", "Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]", "And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it. [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]", "Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.", "And the desk.", "Okay.", "I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...", "You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.", "You wouldn't dare.", "[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.", "If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, \"Well that's pretty premature to think,\" but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.", "Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.", "Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in \"Shagadelic, baby,\" at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?", "[quickly shakes his hands back and forth]", "Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?", "Yep.", "Hey, Dwight. What's up?", "Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]", "He never called a meeting.", "[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?", "Really?", "[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?", "You could just be saying it to get the job.", "How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.", "Okay.", "Did you just trademark that...", "We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an \"Andy for Manager?\" pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.", "Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.", "Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.", "Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?", "Yes.", "Yes.", "[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.", "[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.", "Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?", "[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?", "Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]", "Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?", "Is this a bad time to be doing this?", "Andy? You all set?", "So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?", "[to Gabe] Is it?", "Your department's just you, right?", "Good!", "Yeah.", "Peepa.", "Great.", "No.", "You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.", "[pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.", "Yikes.", "Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]", "Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?", "Okay.", "Thank you.", "Great.", "I'm sure it's fine.", "Howard Cline?", "[checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.", "He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...", "Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]", "That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?", "I think that's probably all we need to hear from...", "That's very...", "You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.", "No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.", "Uh--", "Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.", "No, was it good?", "[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy.

[Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.", "Assistant to the Regional Manager.", "What is it?", "Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.", "[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]", "[looks astonished] Ohhhh!", "This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, \"just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.\"", "Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.", "Um... why Kelly?", "Okay.", "Oh, I didn't know you knew her?", "No.", "You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.", "All right. Name.", "Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.", "I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.", "[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.", "Yes.", "Thank you, Dwight.", "Well, that was quick.", "He's not a real candidate.", "You took the deal.", "That's not okay.", "What is happening right now?", "No, why would you think that?", "Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.", "No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.", "Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.", "Thank you.", "Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?", "[while sighing] I suppose I am.", "Yes.", "Okay.", "Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-", "Hey! Hey! Hey!", "What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?", "What? No, no, it's not a vote.", "I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.", "No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]", "The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California... for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.\u00a0 He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don't really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.\u00a0\u00a0 And he chose...", "Oh, yeah. Pregnant.", "No, I told you I don't like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.", "No one should be planking at all.", "You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it's just gonna make you cry?", "He's got a bank vault. That's a start.", "The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he's gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it's not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It's strange.", "[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay.

I will copy it. Do you have a pen?", "No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?", "We don't need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-", "I promise you, we don't need a warning-", "Left.", "Why are you- How do you know?", "Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert's notebook.", "Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.", "I don't think it's-", "That's not it.", "Mmum, still wrong.", "Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!

I'll text you when we get there. Let you know what's going on.", "Nope. No dog video.", "Okay. See you guys.", "Uhhh, the street?", "Oh, I didn't know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.", "Right.", "Yeah, she does like Elmo.", "Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?", "Shhh.", "Alright, I'm gonna go warm up the car.", "Hey, so this isn't matching up with this...and I'm not sure which one's right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?", "Alright.", "Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?", "Yeah, alright Kev why don't you come with us?", "Does it save time though? \u2018Cause we've been here for about an hour.", "K, Kevin, are you saying \"See the world\"? or \"Sea World?\"", "No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. \u2018Cause I still don't know if you're saying \"Sea World\" or \"see the world,\" and it's taking a lot of time to explain it.", "How many L to a K?", "I'll take five.", "Your ex-wife?", "Wow. Alright. Can't wait to meet her.", "Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim's desk, kicking things in the process.]", "Why don't you start?", "He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?", "New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door...", "She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces.", "We know that.", "You have a walking buddy.", "What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?", "But, what if?", "I don't know, for such a crazy number I'd like something pretty crazy.", "That's pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?", "Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?", "Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work.", "[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week. Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?", "Ok.", "Andrew.", "No, I didn't notice anything.", "I don't know what to tell you, man.", "Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass.", "Nah, you definitely weren't kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]", "Yeah. Big sale. Don't worry about it though, I don't really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though...[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald...can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]", "[on the phone]and I'm back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?", "Gettin' psyched up?", "Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this...", "I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun....and you did that.", "But I think it's big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea....which, by the way, I can't wait for.", "Absolutely not.", "Pull up your pants.", "Do Snowboarders hate animals?", "Dwight! At least aim it.", "Whoa whoa whoa whoa!", "Alright! Nice job, Oscar!", "So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?", "What if he jumps out the window and runs away?", "Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?", "Yeah, that's pretty good.", "Nice job.", "Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.", "I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.", "No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.", "Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?", "Which ideally would be me....", "Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?", "I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...", "Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...", "OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.", "Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!", "There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.", "Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.", "I'd go with that.", "Not that, don't...", "It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-", "Our fake winnings", "It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.", "Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]", "A...hot chocolate tea", "Kevin Costner.", "Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]", "So, it's not the dumbest idea.", "But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.", "So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.", "Is he OK?", "OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.", "That's alright.", "Doesn't matter what the name is. Se\u00f1or Loadenstein, that's stupid.", "That's OK, we're good.", "Porque es muy rapido.", "Right. It's city and country combined.", "And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.", "[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.", "But what are you gonna do about that?", "[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.", "You've seen it, right?", "There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.", "Okay, don't be gross.", "Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?", "[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]", "Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?", "I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing.

No.", "Chapter 4 \u2013 One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master.

Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?", "I don't know if I can.", "Alright.", "I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.", "No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.", "Hey.", "Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?", "Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?", "Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?", "Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.", "Hey it's Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because I've read a lot about this really great documentary.", "[laughs] It's called Ghostbusters.", "It didn't have a buster sign around him? Why don't you draw him? Why don't we see this whole thing.", "I ain't fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!", "You know that's...", "I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.", "Party looks fun doesn't it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.", "[to Dwight] Are you serious?", "That's funny. Ok.", "[whispering] Thank you.", "Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.", "No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...", "Thank you.", "Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, \"Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.\" Now, you say one of two things - one, \"You're just having a bad dream,\" or two, \"Let's go see what it was.\"", "Ok.", "Oh, come on!", "[On phone] ...W R K.", "Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten. Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.", "I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So...my pitch is...me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.", "Is that off again?", "Ok.", "Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?", "Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.", "Dwight, question.", "If this doomsday device goes off...", "If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?", "Ok.", "Nope.", "Hmm...Heda. [alert] No.", "Ok, where is he?", "I'll try both.", "Robert.", "Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.", "You up for a game?", "Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.", "Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.", "In the box.

Yes.", "Here you go. [throws it over glass]", "Awww, sorry. Did it break?", "You sure?", "What kinda iPhone is that?", "Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?", "Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]", "[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]", "I'm alright.", "Yep.", "Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow]", "Yeah. That does not feel good.", "Hmm. Doubt it.", "What's that?", "Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we'd save her from Ryan right?", "Hey.", "Yeah. Super pretty.", "The temp?", "Nope.", "And I'm telling you, I don't.", "No, I don't.", "No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.", "Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]", "Oh, I stand corrected.", "Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.", "Mm-hmm.", "Not his mom's car.", "Touche?", "Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.", "Dwight!", "Dwight! Dwight!", "[to Cathy] Sorry about that.", "Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?", "Leave.", "Mm-hmm?", "[laughs] Told you.", "You okay?", "Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?", "Stop shoving me.", "[to Pam] Really?", "Si.", "Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.", "Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.", "No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.", "No.", "I am not lying.", "Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?", "Yeah, but I don't smoke.", "I don't know.", "Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.", "Okay.", "Thank you.", "Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!", "Okay.", "Oh my God!", "Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!", "How do you feel?", "Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]", "Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?", "No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.", "By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?", "Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.", "Only two hundred dollars?", "Oh wow. So that's two miles if you incorporate the walk back.", "Yeah sorry everyone else didn't come. I think they're just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery.", "What are you talking about?", "Andy \u2013 this whole idea of our situation being just like war? It's just not true. We just work at a paper company. And you're our regional manager. And guess what man? You don't have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head. I'm wearing a very pink hat. I've been getting weird looks all day because I'm pretty sure \"DM does GB\" means something kinda sexual. But guess who's wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. That's huge.", "They're terrible.", "Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting.

[throws money from Dwight's wallet on the floor]", "You know what it's not my best.

He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn't hire his wife.", "Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.", "Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.", "No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself.

See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.", "Perfect!", "Yes?", "[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.", "Yes. All right. Great.

Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.", "So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.", "I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?", "Hmm...", "Nice try, this is ridiculous.", "Three times.", "Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.", "OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...", "[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.", "[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?", "And what's it's name?", "Oops.

It is.", "I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.", "I don't-", "Yeah.", "O...K.", "Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...", "Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.", "I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.", "You alright, Santa?", "Yes.", "Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.", "OK.", "Alright. I will definitely do that.", "You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.", "Yes. They totally do.", "Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.", "All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.", "Okay, done.", "All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-", "You can write a book about chairs.", "Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.", "Stop right there. I love it.", "In Philadelphia.", "That's a great idea.", "Yeah.", "All right, good stuff.", "I thought it was a fun idea.", "Okay.", "There's a table over here.", "Shawn Marion.", "Wrong, for so many reasons.", "Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.", "[claps] All right.", "It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.", "I know.", "[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.", "You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.", "I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.", "I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.", "Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.", "DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.", "You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later.

This night's been magical.", "Really? Why?", "Good night.", "To both these bears.", "To madness.", "Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?", "Are you serious?", "And there's my talking point.", "Hey.", "Okay.", "Yeah.", "It was pretty uneventful, actually.", "Uh, hit and run.", "Nope. Not guilty.", "We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.", "Okay.", "I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.", "Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.", "Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-", "Wow, I'm really sorry.", "I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.", "[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.", "Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.", "Mm-hmm.", "Mm-hmm.", "Okay, wait, wait.", "No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.", "...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.", "Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.", "No.", "No.", "Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?", "Uh-", "The empanada guy!", "Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.", "Because my car broke down.", "Well, I think you handled it pretty well.", "Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.", "Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.", "Funny? No? Nobody laughing?", "Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.", "[to Cece] You want a giraffe?", "Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.", "Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.", "Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.", "Split the difference?", "Okay, let's go.", "What?", "Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.", "Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?", "That was a great idea.", "Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.", "Oh, Aunt Phyllis.", "You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?", "I don't know what else we can do here.", "It's okay.", "All right, all right. Okay.", "All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.", "[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?", "Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?", "Cece!", "Okay, okay, we gotta go.

I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.", "No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.", "Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.", "Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.", "Nope. It's over.", "Nope. OK.", "Ooh, me three.", "I just got a text from Robert California that says \"bring your clubs to Florida\".", "I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?", "\"Robert, Hey!\" Exclamation point.", "\"Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA\" Dash JH.", "Yeah, it's a golf text.", "Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.", "[reading text] Robert, great offer.

They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.", "You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.", "Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]", "Essential.", "Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.", "Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.", "Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.", "Is that the buzzer from Taboo?", "Mosquito.", "So, what is this special project?", "That sounds awesome.", "Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?", "Bye.", "I will.", "I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]", "Puppet.", "Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.", "Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.", "Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, \"For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?\" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?", "That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?", "Yes.", "Loggins and Messina.", "Man.", "Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.", "I would love to hear the other mottos.", "No way.", "It was-", "You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.", "Okay.", "True love's kiss.", "Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.", "Wow. Are you that bored?", "Is that another motto?", "Mmm.", "Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.", "I've spent so much of my life telling myself \"Please, don't end up like Stanley,\" and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.", "Oh, I don't know.", "All right, what the heck? Let's do it.", "Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?", "No one's moving!", "Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.", "The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.", "Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.", "You haven't done any of the research.", "Stanley, are you listening to music?", "You are bleeding through your shirt.", "Catching butterflies.", "Theater.", "Dragging.", "Dragging sticks.", "'Talla-nasty', very clever.", "Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.", "How many buttons do you have?", "College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)", "Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.", "Hey, how's it going?", "Uh... yeah, I'm just watching basketball.", "Okay.", "Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in... March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so... [sits on floor]", "Yes, nice. Good word association", "Yup, coming. [opens door] All right.", "We have plenty.", "Do you want to watch the game with us?

He's indestructible.", "Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...", "OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.", "Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!", "Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!", "What do we want?!", "When do we want it?!", "That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!", "What are you doing?", "You know he's doing all this on purpose.", "Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-", "What?", "Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.", "No.", "I'll take it.", "Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.", "That doesn't matter.", "Ok...that's not...", "Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?", "Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..", "OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.", "It's pretty good actually.", "We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]", "Don't..", "Don't..", "[Group chants along] Pie! Pie! Pie!", "We did it.", "It won't budge.", "Cece's really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.", "It's Okay.", "Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?", "There's a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.", "Gettin' a lot of mileage out of this, aren't ya?", "Are you sure you're okay with me putting in this much money.", "You're the best.", "Okay. I'll see you in a little bit.", "Shut up.", "Wow.", "Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?", "Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we'd really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.", "We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.", "All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool.", "Oh man, it was great. They were great.", "I did, yeah.", "Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...", "Ten. It was the full ten.", "Yeah.", "Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...", "Yeah.", "What is it?", "Um, oh man, I don't actually know.", "They weren't really talking that much about money. They just said, We're good with investing and then I...and I...", "No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.", "You weren't there.", "It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.", "Pam.", "We'll talk about it later.", "I thought that concert was pretty great.", "Angela, it's Halloween. You have to sing \u2018Monster Mash'.", "Uh...", "Okay. We'll, just forget it.", "Because it is Halloween. So if you're going to sing a concert, it's a good idea to throw that one in.", "And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.", "Competent.", "Dwight!", "No, you chose yourself.", "Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.", "[In staff meeting] See these forms...", "What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!", "[using black voice] Good afternoon!

I have the thing.", "I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I'm helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I've ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.", "Yeah, I'm here. Are we all on?", "[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...", "I uh, I have some ideas, actually...", "[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I'd rather be with you guys.", "Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...", "[laughing] Um, you know what? I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.", "I'm gonna try a different spot.

This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don't worry. I'll figure it out.", "Uh, what does -- what does that mean?", "You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?", "What? Yeah, right. As if.", "Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.", "I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.", "[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who's not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?", "This is gonna be awful.", "I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.", "Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I'm gone.", "Yep.", "Oh, great.", "Because we're friends.", "Unfair. When's my birthday?", "How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?", "All right.", "You know, truth be told, I think all you'll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I'm gone.", "You know, at the end of the day, it's really only two days. I mean, I'll be back in the office. \u00a0If you need me for an emergency, call me. \u00a0I'll be there...", "Tell me about it.", "All right. You know what? \u00a0Maybe we'll just...

The blue one with the stripes.", "Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?", "I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.", "So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word \"Philadelphia\"?", "Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?", "Done, right?", "I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?", "Right.", "[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.", "Whoo!", "Yeah, I think so.", "Uh--", "Best Christmas ever.", "Thank you.", "Can't wait.", "I don't know. Is it what you expected?", "So happy right now.", "Yes, he is finally nigh.", "So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.", "Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.", "Oh, it's like naughty or nice.", "Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?", "Oh, nice. Did you check that list?", "But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.", "Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--", "Damn.", "Ooh.", "Oh, you know what? I gotta go.", "Yeah, it's all right.", "I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.", "Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.", "Ooh.", "That's right.", "Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.", "You know what? Yeah. Have at it.", "Ooh! Are you nuts?", "Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.", "Just--Just--Hey!", "[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!", "Aah! Ow!", "[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...", "I'm probably never gonna see you again.", "Okay, sorry, sorry.", "Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.", "I'll call you when I get in.", "All right.", "Love you.", "[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.", "What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?", "What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.", "No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]", "And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.", "Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?", "Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.", "Right?", "Hey, of course.", "Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]", "Go get 'em.", "I think they're going to the conference finals.", "Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]", "I bit my lip at lunch today.", "Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.", "Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]", "Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!", "I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.", "[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?", "Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?", "Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.", "Ok", "Thanks!", "Love you too. Bye.", "Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?", "Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?", "You gotta be kidding me.", "Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.", "Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.", "Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?", "Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?", "It's still happening right now actually, so uh...", "Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?", "Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.", "I love it.", "Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.", "And that's all?", "No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.", "[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.", "Sorry, Stinky, can't do it. Too busy.", "Okay. There's no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.", "Hey, I'm in Philadelphia right now.", "Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?", "No, I hear what you're saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?", "Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.", "Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?", "What are you doing here?", "That's so great!", "It's pretty great, right? I mean, we're coming along... [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis's timeline", "[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.", "Well, I mean, I don't even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so... These things go down all the time.", "[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?", "Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready?", "Let's do it!", "Mm-hm", "And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]", "[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They're going to make you pay for the fish, and... they wanted to know when you can start.", "I think I'm a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.", "The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.", "[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...", "...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?", "I don't.", "Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.", "Hey.", "Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.", "Cece's ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I've been working with her on her move. It's called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It's kind of like this. It's pretty cute, right?", "Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.", "Yeah. Even you.", "Bye, Dwight.", "Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.", "Hey. I was just about to call you.", "I am still in Philly, actually.", "It's insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I'm stuck here trying to keep him on board.", "Pam, I couldn't get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.", "You're gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy's gonna record it. So we'll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?", "Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?", "Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you're not the best with the phone.", "Bye. \u00a0[pause] Yep. See, you've still got to press \"End,\" Pam.", "Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--", "Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he'll be calling in any second.", "Hey.", "We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it.", "I have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.", "Can you figure out how to upload Cece's dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.", "You're not serious, are you? You didn't get any of the recital?", "Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.", "Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video.", "Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it.", "You're not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I'm in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You've agreed to this.", "Pam, I'm not explaining this to you-- Pam, I'm not going over this again.", "I don't know how else to tell you, okay? I'm doing everything I can every week to bring home something...", "I'm doing this just for me? Is that what I'm doing? I'm doing it just for me. If that's what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?", "We'll talk tomorrow?", "Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.", "You could've just called that an alliance too, right?", "Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse.", "I'm talking to him this afternoon, but don't get your hopes up.", "Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix \u2013 me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So... problem solved. Thanks, guys.", "I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.", "I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks.", "I'm sure he's just nervous.", "Sure, yeah, go ahead.", "Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?", "Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so\u2014", "Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.", "Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.", "I need you to breathe in my face right now.", "What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?", "I knew it, I knew it.", "I looked at you coming around, and I said, \"Wintergreen.\"", "How is it my fault?", "But it's Dwight who's bring in all the weirdos.", "Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input\u2014", "I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife\u2014", "Oh. Um...", "Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.", "Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later.", "Uh... [clears throat] Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?", "There's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor \u2013", "Yes, okay. Bye.", "No, thanks.", "Dwight, you can't just hire someone \u2018cause they're your friend.", "Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say.", "But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.", "Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?", "I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.", "Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?", "And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.", "Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.", "Too much now.", "That seems inconsiderate.", "All right. I think that went well.", "So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that'll print out\u2014Hey. Meet your new desk mate.", "Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.", "Okay. I'm really sorry I told the guys I'd be there for the board meeting.", "I'll call you when I get there.", "All right.", "Take care of my wife. I will be back.", "No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I'm gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.", "[in Darryl and Jim's Philly apartment] Hey.", "We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.", "And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.", "I'm couching it!", "And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?", "Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.", "[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.", "Yeah!", "Nice job, man.", "[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.", "Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?", "Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.", "No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.", "No big deal.", "Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...", "[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]", "Hey.", "Yeah. Totally.", "[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.", "I don't think you had to.", "I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?", "That's not the point.", "No, I'm not making bread.", "Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.", "It's all good. Are we all good?", "What's that cooler?", "Oh, crap. Were those yours?", "Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.", "Oh. Oh!", "[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?", "It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.", "By the way, they do need an extra day next week.", "They are terrible.", "Oh my god. That's so romantic.", "Oh my god. That's less romantic.", "Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?", "I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.", "[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.", "What?", "Oh.", "Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.", "Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.", "What?", "Crying?", "I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.", "Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.", "No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.", "You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.", "Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?", "I just feel like we're gonna fight.", "So... how 'bout let's not?", "Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.", "Yeah, yeah.", "No problem.", "You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?", "OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.", "Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?", "You look great.", "Yeah.", "Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]", "You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.", "[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?", "I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!", "Hey, how'd the interview go?", "I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.", "I'll make it worth your while, I promise.", "Alright, love you.", "Hey! Back here.", "Si, senor.", "Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?", "Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.", "Alright. So, tell me all about it.", "Tell me about the cologne. How much?", "You're definitely hoarding this by the way.", "Austin Powers.", "Ferris Bueller.", "Not Night at the Roxbury.", "I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?", "It's fascinating.", "That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?", "So, next interview has to be better.", "What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.", "[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.", "And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]", "My condolences.", "OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?", "[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.", "OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.", "OK.", "Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.", "Oh man. [laughs]", "Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.", "What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?", "Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.", "Yeah, yeah. Exactly.", "Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?", "Ok great.", "Bye.", "Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert.", "Let's go to the conference room.", "With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.", "Right? [laughs]", "Yep.", "Wow.", "Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.", "OK", "Space dust.", "Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood.

Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.", "Mmhm.", "Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do \"opportunities.\"", "An Earl Grey tea for the lady.", "Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.", "Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.", "Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.", "Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.", "Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.", "I guess I will swallow my truth.", "I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?", "Thanks.", "Bye.", "Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]", "I love you.", "I'm taking some time off from work\u2014well, my other work\u2014because we needed it.", "It's great.", "But that doesn't matter. This does. It's the only thing that matters. We've had some really nice days together.", "Beesly! Oh, my god.", "Ah, definitely blue.", "For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin\u2014", "Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can't give 100% to two things at once you know.", "Huh. Well, you know, you can't have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important. That's my new thing.", "Smasher!", "Fireball!", "That's pretty good. I feel safe.", "Oh, Clark. I'm actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.", "You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I'm here.", "What?", "Okay. The annex it is. I'll be sitting at your desk if that's okay with you.", "Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.", "Oh, wow. But, um\u2014Oh, I get that.", "I get it.", "Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don't watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.", "I really felt like I almost lost her, and\u2014and nothing is worth that.", "Again.", "Not at all. It should be Dwight.", "You're gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh\u2014", "Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don't want to meet that person.", "Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?", "I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.", "If you could help me out, that would be\u2014", "Anything would help.", "Oh, also, while you're at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.", "Wow, that's\u2014", "You come so prepared. Aspirin.", "Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great.", "No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.", "I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying.", "Wow, hey.", "What's up?", "Okay.", "Really?", "Yeah, totally you did.", "I need you to stay right here while you think about it.", "All right? I'm gonna wait.", "I'm sure you did not. What was your question?", "Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I'm waiting.", "Look who's back.", "Weeknights are actually tough just because\u2014", "That's true, yeah.", "[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.", "So.", "Let's hear it.", "Nope. Can't accept that job. It's not a real job.", "I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I'd be proud to take.", "Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.", "Oh, don't look at me cause I think you're making a terrible choice.", "You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.", "No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What's up?", "What kind of offer?", "What?", "Oh, my god!", "Wow, that is... wow.", "Yeah, we did. Hey, how long\u2014how long do we think that's gonna take?", "Oh, man. Yeah, I can't do it.", "This, man. I can't do this to Pam.", "I know. And I can't do it.", "Sales form for you to sign.", "Aw, thanks, man.", "No.", "Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.", "All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.", "Yeah.", "I will. I will.", "The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that's final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I'm not risking that again.", "He welcomes you.", "Your agenda-taking pleases him.", "Let's not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you're expecting a fax today, please don't yell out, \"Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.\" Ok? That's nonsense.", "Yes, beautiful girl in the front.", "That's obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?", "Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who's excited?", "I love Star Wars as much as the next guy\u2014", "My god, I'm so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.", "Potential future nonsense.", "I'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You've got a regional manager.", "Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.", "But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?", "Exactly.", "Yeah, right. I mean, unless they're willing to pass some tests.", "Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?", "Nothing.", "Members of the office, hear ye.", "Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.", "This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that's for fueling only. No savoring.", "He envies you.", "Alright.", "By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.", "A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?", "985,000,000,000,017.", "Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?", "Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.", "That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?", "Ew, the exact opposite, actually.", "Come on.", "Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna\u2014", "Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?", "Do you want a corn dog?", "We'll see. You are an assistant who's just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.", "Uncanny.", "An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?", "Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.", "Yeah. It's real. It's the only way you'll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She's through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!", "Look at that form.", "Uncanny. [everyone applauds]", "You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing\u2014none of these people are good enough.", "What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I've ever said.", "Is-", "The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.", "I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That's it. You look really, really good.", "Hey.", "You all right? What's going on?", "Yes, I'm happy.", "Yeah.", "What?", "Pam.", "This was my decision, not yours.", "You didn't force me.", "You did not force me to do this.", "I don't know how else to tell you.", "Resent you?", "Is that really what you think?", "Not enough? I don't know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it's against the rules but I'm gonna need a favor from you guys.", "You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?", "Perform a test.", "Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don't worry, he's the best in the biz.", "Unless you think he can't handle it.", "All right.", "[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.", "Well I've been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn't believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.", "OK, I don't have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.", "I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.", "Ok, um, this is... [leaves DVD with her]\u2014I'll be right back.", "What do we got?", "Wow! Congratulations, that's a really big step.", "Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy.", "[whistles] That's a lot of pros.", "So what is the problem?", "I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.", "Love.", "Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who's gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.", "Not as good as you.", "You got it.", "You watched it.", "Well, then I guess you're ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]", "It's from the teapot. Everything you'll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.", "Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of \"Pilot\"]", "Umm....", "I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too.", "Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.", "[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?", "And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.", "Okay, the limo's gonna be here at five. I need everybody to be ready \u2018cause I want to pack in a lot.", "Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight's night, okay?", "Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I've done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight...only good surprises. \"Guten Pranken\". [chuckles]", "Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up?", "Mose has been weird? That's so unlike him.", "Hey man, good to see you.", "Hey!", "Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? \"Guten Prank\" number one.", "And Jim will say nothing.", "Yeah?", "Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to.", "Get out.", "No, Dwight. You'll be doing the whacking.", "Of course I did.", "Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two.", "Private Room.", "Enjoy, enjoy.", "Okay, man, easy.", "Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?", "Oh, it's the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.", "They think it was Mose.", "Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?", "Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?", "Is that Mose?", "Ooh.", "Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet.", "Okay, just talk.", "I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day.", "Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.", "Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or...", "Right.", "Am I the only one that's nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?", "Doesn't seem like anyone cares about us anyway.", "She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that's fine.", "O-Kay.", "Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.", "You ready?", "Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but... we have a little bit of a problem.", "The minister just told me that it's tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.", "I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you-", "I think it's definitely... Well, okay. Either way...", "Either way, Dwight... I can't be there for you. I'm sorry.", "I just...really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]", "Best prank ever.", "[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don't owe me anything.", "I gotta get out of this dress.", "What's going on?", "No, really, what's going on?", "Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?", "That's why it's so clean.", "I mean, you were gonna do this without me?", "Oh... okay. Where would we go?", "I promise you, you don't have to do this for me.", "The last...", "[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about...", "You wanna do this?", "You really want to do this?", "[hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!", "Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]", "[whispering to Pam] Let's go outside", "You know what? Maybe we should talk.", "Athleap.", "Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note.", "Hey, and if you're ever in Austin...", "There it is.", "Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes...and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that's...an amazing gift.", "Thanks Phyl.", "I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper.

Just a fax.", "You haven't told me.", "Uh, yeah, the one...", "You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.", "I have an important question for you.", "Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?", "This is Mr. Scott.", "I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.", "Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.", "You just still have these messages from yesterday.", "What?", "Don't we all?", "Nothing.", "I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.", "Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]", "[Laughing]", "Yeah.", "So when are we going out?", "OK. Yeah.", "Hey.", "Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.", "Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?", "OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.", "You got a fax.", "What? Why?", "Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?", "Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?", "Are you serious?", "I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.", "You're a jerk.", "Hey.", "Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...", "It's better, thanks.", "Yeah.", "Is...?", "Um... Are you...", "Yes.", "Yeah.", "Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.", "Yeah, Freecell.", "I know. I saw that.", "I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.", "Um, hi. How are you?", "Great.", "Thank you.", "That's nice, Dwight.", "OK, I like your food.", "OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.", "[stirs] Mmmm.", "Oh.", "Sorry.", "I'm not making any copies.", "Nothing new.", "There's nothing new.", "Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]", "No. I have a life.", "You should try it sometime.", "[laughs]... your problem.", "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.", "Where are you?", "Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...", "No you're not.", "OK.", "Still no one calling.", "Dwight, what...", "OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?", "This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.", "Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?", "Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.", "Michael, he made huge cuts.", "Where are you going?", "I'm inventing new diseases.", "So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?", "Nice.", "It's an epidemic.", "[on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam.", "Good, how are you? Busy?", "Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?", "You don't have anything you're doing?", "Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.", "I might go to the mall.", "I need new shoes.", "Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.", "Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.", "Oh.", "Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.", "But it's not until next month.", "You still want to have a party?", "How about green?", "This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.", "It is... her birthday.", "An alliance?", "What does that even mean?", "[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?", "Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?", "Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, \"These people are my friends.\" But he's all like, \"This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.\" But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.", "OK, yeah.", "He's in a box?", "[on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...", "Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card]", "Oh, tell me, tell me.", "[laughing] That's perfect!", "Hey, Hey!", "Come on.", "It's just office pranks.", "My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.", "[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.", "Please don't throw garbage at me.", "I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.", "Maybe Angela would cheerlead.", "Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones.", "Yeah, you're gonna need it.", "[laughing] I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive.", "And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...", "Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake.", "Woo!", "Mmm-hmm.", "Hey.", "Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let's get you into a tub.", "Uh, Michael?", "Hey, there's a...", "There's a person here...", "There's...", "There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.", "Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.", "Okay.", "There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.", "No.", "That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.", "It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with.", "We're not dating, we're engaged.", "[smiles]", "[mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.", "Oh!", "Oh...", "Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad.", "[smiles in agreement]", "You're horrible.", "Yeah, what's that?", "I'm engaged. So...", "I wished, right?", "Yeah, I gave it to you.", "So, can I..?

We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.", "I'm bored.", "No, I'm kidding.

Yes.", "Great.", "Okay, I'm gonna head back.", "I guess.", "What?", "Wired.", "Oh, yeah.", "Smoked turkey.", "Um, that spells incest.", "It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.", "Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...", "Seventy-six percent. What's yours?", "You're doing fine.", "People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.", "No.", "No.", "No.", "No.", "No.", "It didn't have anything to do with race.", "One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.", "What card was she?", "We stole Dwight's trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign.", "Mmm hmm.", "Mmm hmm.", "Yeah.", "You promise these are confidential?", "Did you just mark on that?", "You made a \"P.\"", "In case I get sick.", "Because we're not married.", "We haven't set a date.

[Angela, Phyllis, and Pam all whispering] ... seriously, we're just...", "New pants?", "Abercrombie & Fitch?", "Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.", "You know Michael's been talking to her too.", "What do you think his chances are?", "[laughs] I like that song.", "[laughs] 10 years ago.", "Ugh...", "You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.", "Michael has taped every Dundies awards and now, he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights.", "Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.", "[quietly laughing] It wasn't. I swear.", "We're not laughing at you, Dwight.", "Um, just something somebody wrote.", "Um, it's kind of private.", "Okay, now I'm laughing at you.", "You're taking away our bathroom?", "Michael...", "...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.", "Um...", "Sorry.", "...because that's what happens every time!", "No.", "[Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.", "If you would have asked me that, then you would know.", "Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.", "I'll just get a ride home from Angela.", "Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping.", "[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?", "No, no.

Fine work Stanley!", "Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in]", "I have so many people to thank for this award.", "Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.", "Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.", "And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight.

Just, my Mom's coming in today.", "Thanks, Kevin.", "Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.", "She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.", "Thank you.", "Uh... my mother's coming.", "I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.", "[ecstatic] Oh my god!", "Hello!", "I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.", "Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.", "This is where I used to keep my computer.", "But then I moved it.", "Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...", "So this is like, um, an organization station...", "Hey!", "Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit.

I think she'll be here this afternoon.", "She missed you.", "I have one idea of what it means.", "Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.", "Because she's conflicted.

I guess the person I have the most in common with is...", "Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.", "Thanks.", "Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...", "Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...", "Hey.", "How's it going down there?", "Good.

She made it sound, like, really great.", "Um...", "It's really cool.", "Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve.

Just a bunch of little reasons.", "Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.", "What? You have something you want to say?", "Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!", "Yeah.", "It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .", "Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.", "I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school.

It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.", "That you remember her.", "Yeah.", "[delivering plant to Oscar's desk] Oscar.", "[walks away] Join the club.", "Hey.", "I guess, yeah.", "Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.", "I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me something for Valentine's Day.", "Heading out?", "Bye.

I'll uh show them to you later.", "Ok, cool.", "I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward.

I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...", "Do we know anyone who was in the accident?", "You mean Toastmasters?", "Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?", "Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.", "Of course. He's one of my closest friends.", "Maybe we'll use a DJ.

No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.", "It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work.

[Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim---", "[loud sigh] Chicken.", "Excellent, thanks.", "Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it.

It's just a bird.\" But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.", "And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.", "An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.

Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?", "No thanks, guys.", "Have fun though.", "Really? Where did you hear that?", "Okay.", "Yeah.", "Yeah, me too.", "Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain.

How fast are you?", "Really?", "Oh, I'll just time him later.", "Yeah. Are you ready?", "Set", "Go!", "Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose.

Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.", "I should probably get back to work.", "Good morning!", "Okay.", "Yes! I'm in a good mood today!

I know, me too.", "The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.", "Hey!", "Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.", "What's up?", "What do you mean?", "Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.", "We're friends. We'll always be friends.", "It's good to have you back.", "Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!", "...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink.", "...Oh. That's... fun for him.", "[whispering] Who is it?", "Why would anyone go to jail for that?", "Okay. Angela?", "My dad.", "What was prison like?", "Yeah, some days I never go outside.", "They have art classes?", "Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.", "Wow... I--", "Wow. That was... wow.", "Michael, it's freezing out.", "Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?", "Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that.

I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.", "For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.

Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.", "Um, usually like that.", "I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.

We just started it.", "What's ours again?", "Oh right.", "Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer.

Maybe.", "Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .", "Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]", "Good choice.

Hmm.", "We'll go tell everyone.", "Night.", "We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.", "It costs seventy five dollars.", "Ohh... [laughs]", "Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.", "OK.", "It's kind of serious.", "How was Jamaica?", "That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell]", "Huh.", "It's kind of an impoverished country.", "But you can't today, we're doing inventory.", "We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.", "Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor]", "On the left.", "Hey.", "You OK?", "You sure?", "Oh. You want to talk about it?", "Hmm.", "How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?", "Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.", "No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.", "Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!", "[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.", "He'll call you back. OK, great.", "Hey.", "What are you doing out here?", "Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.", "That's all she said.", "Sorry?", "Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.", "Sure.", "What? No, it's not... it's nothing.", "Yeah.", "[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.", "Yeah.", "Great.", "Who is 'Long Tim'?", "I would love to meet Long Tim.", "Yeah.", "Ok. Bye Harvey.", "Really?", "Ok. Sure.", "Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.", "That's great.", "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?", "Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.", "Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.", "$100.", "Cool. Congratulations.", "Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.", "Oh.", "Oh?", "Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.", "No, thanks. I had some already.", "Oh, but, hey, Jim.", "I won an art contest today.", "Thanks.", "I sent in one of my watercolors.", "It was the new one I did.", "Yeah.", "Thanks.", "Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?", "Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.", "Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.", "Nope.", "[takes the phone] Hmm.", "Angela?", "Is everything okay?", "Yeah.", "I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker]", "No, I will not.", "What?", "No. No. [Leaves]", "Something's up with Jim and Karen. Not that I've been eavesdropping. It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck.", "Hey.", "Ugh.", "Everything okay?", "Well you seem a little tired.", "You should get more sleep.", "Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.", "When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.", "Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not.", "Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk. [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God.", "I think that's champagne.", "But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris? Like a lot of them?", "Okay Ben Franklin!", "Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?", "Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.", "What do you mean?", "Oh yeah.", "Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing. You should definitely go out with Jim. I mean, you're going out with Jim. I'm not going out with Jim. You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.", "I'm not into Jim. Yeah.", "Yeah. Sorry.", "Um, what?", "Nothing. I was just thinking of something else.", "I know.", "Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis?", "Ohhh.", "Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever.", "Yeah? I lose my appetite all the time.", "Thanks.", "Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.", "Also, Pam and Roy.", "That's my dress.", "What do you mean?", "Oh... um... no. That's... um... That's actually fine", "Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks", "Hey.", "You're kidding me, right?", "Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.", "Yeah.", "It's okay.", "Hey!", "Oh... I'm pacing myself.", "No. I'm such a dorky dancer.", "Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.", "Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.", "Thanks.", "I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.", "You too.", "Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.", "Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.", "I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.", "Dwight, what are you doing?", "Oh! No, you should go.", "...And it's all from the same series.", "Called 'Impressions.'", "Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.", "I hope so.", "I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever.

Thank you.", "Do you have something in your pocket?", "No thank you.", "So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?", "No, no.", "Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.", "Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.", "I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly.

You made it.", "Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.", "[looks at beers] Oh.

I was looking forward to hanging out with you.", "Hey, don't you have a daughter?", "I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.", "Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.", "Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.", "He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.", "Just listen.", "Don't yell!", "This is over.", "ROY!", "Roy don't! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy]", "I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked.", "Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!", "Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.", "[Laughing, covering her mouth]", "It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.", "Sorry I almost got you killed.", "He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right?", "Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now.", "Jim... I am really... sorry.", "I don't know.", "I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.", "Um... no. No, he has a girlfriend.", "No, there were a lot of reasons.", "I know.", "Oh, welcome back, Andy.", "Oh. Drew. Sorry.", "It's called being smart.", "I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.", "Ten...", "47, 48, 49! Jim wins!", "I don't understand the question.", "Yeah...", "It's really hard to demonstrate depression.

Oh my God, he's gonna jump.", "Yeah...", "Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.", "Come down and... open it and you'll see.", "Dwight, what are you---", "[on phone] Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations?", "Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.", "We're having a press conference?", "Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye.", "It's just the Scranton Times...", "You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.", "Yes.", "Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch.", "Cut.", "Cut.", "One day for what?", "OK.", "Cut. That was your best apology video ever.", "Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today.", "[door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?", "What? Really?", "Oh, my God.", "[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?", "[whispering] It's just, like, so creepy.", "Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.", "Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.", "It's disgusting and demeaning.", "Phallus?", "I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.", "That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.", "[reads memo] \"Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.\" Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]", "Yeah.", "Uh, Phyllis got a good look.", "[tires screeching] Oh.", "Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter.", "What do you want to dish about?", "OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?", "Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.", "Oh, my God.", "Michael, you need to get out of this.", "No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]", "Read the pros first.", "What was the last one?", "Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.", "Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.", "No one said it has no calories.", "I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.", "Don't answer it.", "Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.", "I think I've got it.", "I don't think we really need that, Michael.", "You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy.

It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle.

[finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.", "A piece of paper.", "Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.", "Are you serious?", "Okay.", "Just checking in, how's it going?", "I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.", "Talk to you later?", "Excuse me.", "[clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?", "Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]", "Well done.", "Hi.", "I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?", "Yeah. Can I fill out an application?", "I can do that.", "I don't know any of those.", "New York or Philadelphia.", "All right. Cool, well... thanks.", "And uh, I'll look into those.", "New York or Philadelphia.", "Okay.", "Thanks.", "Hey, is this Dwight?", "Oh my goodness, you sound sexy.", "Have you?", "Dwight?", "I'm confused...", "Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?", "So how much antigravity potion do you want?", "Hi, can I help you?", "Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek]", "Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.", "Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!", "I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw \"congratulations\" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.", "So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...", "Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.", "Ohh... [they hug; she laughs]", "I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word \"perfect\" in here!", "Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.", "Well I was taking the picture.", "Sure, do you have a camera here?", "Okay...", "[enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?", "Okay.", "Toby, why don't you open your present?", "Michael...", "So what is your gift?", "What is it?", "Your watch?", "I just knew.", "Is that the police?", "Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver]", "Wow. Look at our parking lot.", "Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?", "[everyone applauds] Yay, Phyllis!", "Song parody writer.", "I like that one.", "I like that one.", "I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.", "Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.", "Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music]", "Oh, yeah, um...", "Sure. Meredith, do you mind?", "I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...", "Michael.", "Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]", "Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch. [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk. She rolls to her side, away from Pam] Kelly?", "I got it.", "Hey, Michael.", "Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner. She wants you to call her.", "Sure.", "Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry. So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry.", "Hey, Dwight, what about vaccines?", "Excuse me?", "Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.", "[interrupting] The city mirrors, or the...?", "The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?", "Put cold tea bags on your eyes.", "Yeah.", "Mmhmm.", "Mmm. Mmm-mmm. [shakes head 'no']", "[Mose serves bacon] Thank you, Mose.", "Where'd he go?", "Mose, Angela hasn't been around here much lately, has she?", "Angela - she used to stay here sometimes?", "Okay, we're watching, Mose!", "Yeah.", "Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.", "Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]", "How about Darryl?", "Oh, my God. His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.", "[on phone] So, there was no sales call.", "Wait, you're going along with this now?", "Right. And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.", "A little bit.", "Because you love her? [baby voice] Because you love her very much?", "Okay. Have fun with your girlfriend!", "I'm kidding around. We joke about that stuff all the time. I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen. I care a little.", "Oh, it's Creed's birthday today. Should we get him an ice-cream cake? Mint chocolate chip?", "Oh, no.", "Yes, I have been working with you forever.", "I don't think so.", "Here's the thing. When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.", "I do.", "No.", "You're welcome. Open or closed?", "No.", "Yeah. Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]", "Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.", "Couple minutes, give or take.", "What are you doing?", "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand] Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice. Okay? I'm not kidding!", "Now. Get good work done. Concentrate.", "On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters]", "[to Jim, quietly] Food!", "[quietly] Not with your hands.", "Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out. [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]", "Mmm-mm. I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.", "It was just a little...", "Where did you grow up?", "Wow, you did neighborhood watch?", "I don't have anybody.", "No...", "Sorry.", "No, I don't, I...", "I just...", "Are you talking about Beverley?", "Because she's not a s*x model. She's a tollbooth operator.", "That's the other Boleyn girl.", "Shh.", "Mmm?", "I'm supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it's part of my job.", "What kind of stuff does Stanley say?", "Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude. Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.", "Hi everyone. My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.", "Thanks, Phyllis. Yours, too.", "Really?", "Huh. Maybe I will.", "What's it like without my glasses? Um, well, here, I'll show you. Unfocus your lens. A lot. I'm 20/400. You got it? Okay, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day like this. I can't see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day. I can't see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael... it's great.", "Hi, can I help you?", "[pointing] Ryan!", "Yeah.", "Okay.", "I've heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor]", "Okay.", "Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.", "Hi, nice to meet you.", "[to Toby] Thank you!", "Hey.", "Did you just buy that?", "Ahh! I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't see you come in.", "Dwight. [to Troy] Michael will be out in a second.", "Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...", "Just, we'll just keep going.", "Yes.", "Yes.", "I have everything.", "Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?", "I should really get going.", "I'm sure it was really lovely.", "OK, bye.", "No, Michael.", "I'm in the wrong class...", "Oh, no. I just--", "[on computer screen] I can see you!", "This is so cool.", "Lunch with a girl from my hall.", "Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.", "Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?", "The nerve.", "They're on the supply shelf.", "New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?", "Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera]", "What?", "Really, where?", "Wow, was it the age difference?", "Hey! Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit? I made friends!", "[to friend] Nice.", "Sorry.", "You've already disappointed him so much. He can't be expecting a lot from you.", "I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?", "No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.", "OK.", "Hey! This is not half-way! I did the math. I had to drive way longer than you. Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.", "What are you doing?", "Oh my God!", "Oh my God!", "Yes! [they embrace and kiss]", "[on the phone] Well, I should go.", "No, don't. I'm mad at them.", "Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.", "What? Why not?", "Come on, it won't be that bad.", "[speakerphone] Hi everyone!", "Wow.", "No, nothing. Nothing Michael! Just saying hi. [Michael waves \"hi\" at the phone]", "Sorry.", "[on phone] So you know Stacy, right?", "There's no one from England, Jim. Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.", "So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.", "Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in.", "No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.", "So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, \"No way. You can't reserve seats.\" And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.", "Yes!", "No, it's horrible! Jim, she might get arrested.", "No, Stacy is a boy. Ugh. Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me?", "Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]", "Hey you!", "Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.", "I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-", "I can't hear anything!", "OK.", "I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Oh, great. I washed my lipstick.", "Hi.", "[on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam. Leave a message.", "I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but...", "I'll leave a message.", "I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better.", "I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.", "And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?", "You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now. But, don't worry, I'm being safe. And I'm headed home. I'm... headed to my dorm. Not home.", "Anyway, um... I miss you.", "Okay, thanks.", "New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.", "Hey.", "Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.", "Hey Michael.", "Hey.", "Thanks. My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]", "So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.", "Hey!", "How are you Tom. Nice to see you.", "I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, \"That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.\"", "Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.", "So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?", "Okay, okay.", "Oookay....", "They came up with that idea really fast.", "Hey guys.", "Hi! [smooches]", "Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]", "Cute.", "Miles Davis.", "Chet ...something.", "Dizzy Gillespie.", "I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.", "I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...", "... Got you.", "For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.", "Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.", "Thank you.", "Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?", "[on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work.", "It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.", "We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.", "I should go.", "[listening in New York] I miss him.", "Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine.", "[Dwight slams something on desk] What was that?", "Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?", "[whispers on bluetooth] Good luck.", "I love you.", "[touches ear] Jim? Jim?", "Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.", "[on Bluetooth] Ooh, cute shoes online.", "[in New York, humming to herself to the tune of \"Centerfold\"] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.", "[in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!", "[on Bluetooth] That was weird.", "Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?", "Did you do something to her?", "Well, something's off.", "Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.", "[in New York] Right Dwight is loud.", "Hey, what are you doing here?", "It's Alex.", "Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.", "OK.", "What's up?", "Wow.", "Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.", "Jim's in Scranton.", "I'll see you tomorrow.", "[at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs]", "[over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.", "I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark. I hate computers.", "I have to stay and retake it.", "That means another twelve weeks. [pause] Can you do this for another three months?", "[over phone] I know.", "[starting to cry] Right.", "[over phone] Yeah I'm fine. Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go.", "Alright.", "[over phone] Love you. Bye.", "I'm coming back the wrong way. [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?", "I missed you too. [Jim kisses her]", "Uh, yeah.", "I'm not going inside.", "[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this? Disgusting.", "Yeah. Wait, what, the mess or the note?", "Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?", "Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.", "When it comes down to it, it's a health issue. I should have written that.", "[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?", "Are you inching away from me?", "Reach your arms out.", "What do you need, Michael?", "\"Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle. I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.\"", "Thank you.", "I know, can you believe it?", "I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?", "How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?", "You've seen things cleaned before though, right?", "I don't know anything about that.", "Here?", "Sure.", "[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?", "I don't get it.", "I love it.", "Yeah, I love it!", "I mean, you bought me a house!", "You bought me a house!", "Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?", "And the clown?", "New chairs?", "Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.", "[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...", "Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.", "Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.", "Michael?", "I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.", "What? Jim.", "Hey.", "So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...", "I really think you should reconsider.", "Yeah, I know.", "But I really think you should reconsider.", "Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.", "Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?", "Well that never happened.", "So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.", "Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?", "Aww.", "That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]", "Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door]", "Michael?", "Hey!", "You got a second?", "Oh, good.", "Oh, that must've been so fun.", "Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?", "Yeah, is that a new tie?", "That is amazing!", "What?", "No.", "[applauding] No way!", "Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.", "Yeah.", "Here's what I was thinking[/b]: everyone sits on a chair every day...", "But not everyone...", "Or even uses the copier every day.", "Yeah, right?", "...That's it. [giggles]", "All right, see you later...", "Hot tie guy.", "No, copier's great.", "Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]", "And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]", "So suck it.", "There's that ass!", "Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!", "Did somebody call Hank?", "You can try mine.", "Yeah, know what?", "You can do that?", "You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?", "Or chairs?", "So what's it gonna be?", "Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.", "Hey.", "Thanks Michael.", "Yeah, I guess, since I won.", "I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.", "I know. If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]", "I knew it.", "I knew some of it.", "It's Christmas.", "Thank you. I knew it.", "[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?", "Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun.

They're kind of spicy.", "Yeah.", "So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...", "Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.", "Of course you will.", "Oh my God!", "Have you seen her with her bangs?", "[disapprovingly] Kevin!", "Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.", "No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation]", "Hillary swank.", "[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!", "The phones are dead.", "Try a different door.", "What do we do?", "We don't normally download films illegally. Because we're honest, hardworking people.", "But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.", "My dad spent the night at our place last night. My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks. Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.", "He's not saying what he needs to say.", "Yeah.", "Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.", "So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?", "Hey.", "Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?", "[sighs]", "I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.", "You're good to talk to.", "What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...", "Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?", "What did you say to my dad?", "After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.", "What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?", "Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.", "Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle!

Thanks.", "I think he meant personal day.", "Phyllis there's a package for you.", "Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.", "Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.", "Yeah. [they hug]", "When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]", "Michael! It's really good to see you.", "What?", "Ugh.", "Good morning.", "He brought a sled.", "Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days.

I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.", "No, that was a long time ago.", "No, I'm not even wearing that much.", "I hate the idea that someone out there hates me.

Let's do this.", "We're engaged.", "Oh, wow, thank you!", "... Okay, let's go.", "So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure.

Yeah.", "You look good.", "I'm so sorry, Michael.", "She's not doing it to hurt you.", "Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-", "You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.", "Yeah, maybe.", "Maybe. One step at a time.", "You can do this.", "Oh, God.", "Michael, get off the floor!", "[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-", "That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs.

Listen Michael. Have you really thought this through? 'Cause it's a pretty big risk.", "Yeah... you could give it up though right?

You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast.

We need to get you dressed!", "I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships.

I'd like my old job back.", "Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.", "Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.", "Personal shopper?", "Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.", "I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay.

Happy birthday.", "I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.", "Kevin!", "Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]", "Oh, you guys. Just one second. [picks up phone] Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch.", "I know. Isn't that always how it goes?", "I want to handle it.", "I feel like its--", "Yeah-- it's exciting.", "Thank you.", "Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.", "I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.", "Michael, you did all this?", "So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?", "49 again? That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition.", "Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?", "Please be Grandma.", "I want you to be Grandma.", "Yay, Grandma!", "Maybe.", "What about your gift Michael?", "He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.", "Aww--", "That's amazing.", "Yeah.", "That's really nice Michael.", "Home run Michael.", "Hey. Where'd you go?", "And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?", "Okay, weirdo. Come on. It's time for cake.", "Cakes really good.", "Michael. Michael ,it's okay.", "I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy.", "Well--", "Michael.", "What?", "I am working.", "Really?", "Really?", "Why?", "I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.", "I have the worst attitude of any person here.", "Yeah, I'll take it. [turns to leave]", "You're bribing me?", "I want to hit you.", "I want to hit you. I'll do that.", "No. Are you kidding?", "No. I don't think I can hit you in the office.", "So, um... we'll do it after work. In the parking lot. In front of everyone. I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.", "Okay.", "See you then.", "Oh...", "Right.", "Okay.", "[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.", "Okay. [punches Toby's hand]", "Wow!", "Are you ready?", "[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.", "Michael, you have to put your hands down.", "What are you sorry for?", "How about for dating my mom?", "And dumping her on her birthday.", "Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.", "Are you okay?", "You're okay.", "No. You were right.", "Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.", "Who are you?", "I'll go. [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent] My name is Deborah U. Tante. Deb for short.", "Bill Bourbon was my uncle. I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.", "I do not.", "I think Michael may have snapped.", "Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?", "Jim, what if we both lose our jobs? I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.", "I should just go. [accent] Where to now Caleb?", "[Jim comes out of the office] What's the news?", "[accent] It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this!", "Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]", "Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.", "The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.", "A world where you truly can be anything you want.", "That's great.", "Sure.", "Don't do the twirl.", "Stuff gets around. I don't participate.", "I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.", "Can you actually fire people?", "Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.", "Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.", "Well, you'll figure it out.", "[glances at it] Looks great.", "Okay. [picks up and reads sheet] The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?", "Michael, why did you promise that?", "No Michael, why would you promise that?", "Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.", "It's terrible.", "Just terrible. And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.", "No!", "You have to tell them.", "It's fine. Erin, you're going to go. And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.", "Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.", "Thank you.", "No, wait, come on. I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.", "Yup.", "Ah!", "Is it, is it fake?", "So Santa, what can we expect from this party?", "You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!", "Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot] I think my water just broke!", "Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!", "Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.", "Have you talked to him?", "Matt?", "Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?", "Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.", "Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?", "Okay.", "Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.", "How could we do what? [general murmur]", "Twelve drummers drumming. [marching drum band lines up to perform, Andy steps out with cymbals]", "Hello.", "Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.", "It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.", "For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.", "Good to meet you.", "Well, maybe we can put the box back together.", "[Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep.", "Yep.", "Yes.", "Oh, Michael.", "No, don't!", "What do you want us to do?", "Because we're usually not on the same page.", "Hey.", "Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.", "We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.", "We're hoping our interview seals the deal.", "Okay. Okay. Yeah.", "There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?", "What?", "Who? The -", "The guy we're meeting with?", "Hi Jerry.", "It's lovely.", "Ok, you've got to pull it together.", "He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.", "That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.", "Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?", "Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.", "Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.", "So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.", "[pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!", "Michael, stop.", "Michael...", "[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.", "[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks.", "There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.", "Kevin, you're such a gourmand.", "Hmm.", "Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?", "No, no. I still have time.", "I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.", "If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.", "I cannot wait for that joke to be over.", "Ooh.", "You know the baby's not going to live here, right?", "Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight.", "Everything's fine. We have plenty of time.", "Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet.", "No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.", "I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.", "Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.", "Five minutes apart.", "Okay, stop watching me.", "Mm-hmm.", "Not until midnight.", "Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.", "Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking.", "Oh, thanks, Kelly.", "Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.", "Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times.", "Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.", "Why don't you go do some work?", "I know, you don't like to be frazzled.", "Okay.", "Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.", "Okay, Jim.", "Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay?", "I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad.", "Mm-hmm.", "I know.", "Good.", "Okay.", "Oh, yeah, my water broke.", "[enters the office and has another contraction] Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow.", "No, not yet, Michael.", "Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin?", "There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there.", "Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.", "Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine.", "They're not that bad still, babe.", "No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay.", "No, it's passing, it's fine.", "Ah, no, it passed. It's good.", "Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine. [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.", "Oh, God. Oh, no.", "Jim, we waited too long!", "I don't want to have my baby here.", "The hospital.", "A baby.", "Dwight, get away!", "Michael!", "Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on.", "Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here!", "It has the birth song on it!", "Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.", "I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!", "Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under...", "Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...", "Dwight just listen! It's underneath... [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]", "Yes.", "No, Jim, stay!", "Okay.", "This is happening!", "Oh, my God.", "[with Jim, holding the baby] She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again?", "Okay.", "Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months.", "Okay.", "Love you, mom.", "Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.", "Again, no pants.", "Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?", "Good.", "Doesn't she sleep here?", "[as the baby yawns] Oh, big yawn.", "One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down.", "She's not gonna... Just...", "Go.", "I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.", "Doesn't feel right.", "How does one do that?", "Do you want to try it, Jim?", "I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right.", "Even if she's not getting anything?", "No. I read in the book about nipple confusion.", "She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.", "Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.", "I know.", "Yes?", "Um, yeah, that would be great.", "So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...", "Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything.", "Okay.", "Okay.", "No, I mean, it feels... pressure.", "No. It just feels like pressure.", "Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if...", "Okay. Aw, thank you.", "Okay.", "Oh, shoot.", "Shoot, she fell off.", "Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?", "Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.", "[trying to sleep as the baby cries] Jim, Jim, get her.", "Get the baby. Get her. Come on.", "I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched.", "Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the \"C thing.\"", "Aw, we're doing it.", "We're really parents now.", "Oh, hey, Isabelle.", "Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby!", "Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh.", "Oh, my gosh.", "No, not at all.", "Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...", "Okay, please hurry.", "Oh, yeah, sorry.", "Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it.", "Hi. We did it.", "I used a variation of your move.", "It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.", "[over phone] Hey baby, what's up?", "Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.", "He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.", "Hey, thanks.", "It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.", "[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it?", "It's nice to see you again, Dwight.", "[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.", "No, no, he's right.", "That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?", "You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?", "Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!", "What are you doing?!", "Relax?!", "Give it back to me now.", "It's disgusting!", "It's not sterile!", "Jim does a really good one. Do yours.", "No, no never.", "[imitating Cookie Monster] \"Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.\"", "What? What do you mean, suspend me?", "Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.", "Yeah. And he worked here too.", "No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.", "Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek]", "[answers phone] Hey Toby.", "Very interesting.", "[Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.", "I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.", "Yeah. \"I vant to count to ten\".", "That would have been funny.", "You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] \"I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.\"", "This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.", "We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.", "[vaudeville delivery] Yee.", "Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.", "I'll have one.", "Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.", "What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?", "Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.", "Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.", "Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]", "Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.", "You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?", "I was after your money.", "Yes, it was.", "Hmm?", "Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.", "Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.", "I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.", "Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?", "You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.", "Mm-hmm.", "Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.", "Michael...", "She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.", "I'm sorry.", "Michael! [sighs]", "It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, \"I will when you lose the baby weight.\"", "Stanley got to go.", "No, Michael, no.", "You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...", "That is right. Don't make any more of it.", "How what?", "You could start by concluding this meeting.", "Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.", "Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.", "Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.", "Oh!...", "Why do we have to see what Dwight says?", "No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.", "Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.", "Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.", "And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.", "Helene.", "My mother.", "My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]", "Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.", "Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.", "No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.", "So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.", "Hey, Michael.", "I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.", "I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.", "And...", "No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...", "Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my s*x life with Jim.", "[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!", "I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]", "[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?", "Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office]", "I don't know who he is.", "What?", "You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.", "You have to settle down first.", "Okay. Okay. Yes.", "Yeah, but you have to calm...", "Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.", "[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael", "[gasps] Did she see me?", "What flavors did you get? [yawns]", "[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?", "No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.", "Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.", "[yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.", "And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.", "Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.", "No, out! Get out now! Leave now.", "Leave!", "Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?", "That's awesome. You want some ice cream?", "Could he still be seeing her?", "Me too!", "Hey Michael.", "We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.", "We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.", "Yes.", "[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?", "Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.", "You were supposed to be the Lookout.", "So embarrassing.", "We will be well-rested tomorrow.", "I don't think those were yours to take.", "Did you talk to him?", "You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.", "I don't think I'm gonna make it.", "[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.", "Well, it does and it doesn't.", "You sleep in the warehouse?", "Okay.", "It was me.", "Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...", "She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!", "Her husband's a reporter.", "So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.", "I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.", "I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!", "That fast?", "[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.", "Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.", "[in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.", "Um...", "We're not going for yogurt.", "Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?", "I don't think that's a good idea.", "Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.", "Yes, it's totally obvious.", "[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?", "Sorry.", "It was really funny.", "I love you.", "Why is there a circle with a line through it?", "Or enough for everyone?", "Get whatever you want, on me.", "I don't know. That usually works.", "I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.", "Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses \"Doors closed\" the doors open. Or he presses \"lobby\" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?", "Dwight is about to get so Pammed.", "Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.", "There we go.", "Let's just calm down.", "I don't-", "Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!", "Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!", "You've gotta be kidding me.", "Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.", "I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.", "Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.", "They do call me that.", "Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.", "Yeah.", "Stop drinking the water! Stop!", "We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...", "Were you painting in the dark?", "I don't really think we need...", "Yeah.", "And a soy sauce packet.", "[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.", "I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.", "Tell me I'm good at sales.", "The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.", "Yeah, what happened Dwight?", "So what happened?", "[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!", "Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.", "There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.", "A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?", "Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?", "I get paid $40,000 per year.", "Maybe $50,000.", "No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.", "I liked them.", "Hey, do you have a second?", "Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.", "And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.", "I just think somebody lost the paperwork.", "Yes. Absolutely. Right away.", "Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to... [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]", "There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.", "We can do that.", "Easily.", "But of course!", "So weird that there is no paperwork.", "Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.", "Admit what?", "Say it.", "Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.", "Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.", "Sure. Anything else?", "I'll get it right away.", "The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.", "Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.", "We'll keep looking.", "I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.", "Yeah.", "Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!", "We can relax.", "Sounds like Cece.", "[sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!", "Why are you here?", "What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.", "You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.", "Okay.", "Not together!", "This night was a disaster.", "Yeah?", "Get it.", "Let's get our juice on.", "No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees]", "[Nate starts walking away from hornet's nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!", "Yeah, go away. [Kelly nodding]", "What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.", "It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.", "Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.", "Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.", "Andy that's way too personal of a question.", "Okay.", "[crashing sound] Michael!", "Come on, Michael! Yeah!", "Not the car!", "Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.", "That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.", "No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?", "You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.", "You don't?", "Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.", "[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]", "People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!", "What?", "I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.", "We were basically Romeo and Juliet.", "Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.", "But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.", "And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?", "[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.", "Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.", "It was two.", "No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...", "Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.", "Hmm-mm.", "Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.", "Michael, this is a bad idea.", "Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?", "Angela as the nurse!", "I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.", "I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like \"gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.\"", "Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.", "Oh, wow!", "Aww, my hero!", "Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.", "I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.", "One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.", "Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]", "Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.", "And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.", "I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.", "Cece's getting christened today.", "Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.", "Oh, Michael, this is just for family.", "Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.", "I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.", "Okay, thank you.", "Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.", "No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.", "Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.", "[looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change.", "Well, she can't bring this up with her.", "[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?", "Honey, no.", "No, no.", "We have an extra outfit in the bag.", "You said you checked it.", "Wow.", "We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.", "Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.", "[to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.", "I don't know. I'm just hungry.", "[sighs] Cece went down.", "Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either.", "Who the heck was that?", "We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.", "[walks up] Honey.", "Did you lose Cece?", "She's up! Great!", "Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night.

Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.", "You have a gun in your desk?", "Maybe I should go.", "If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.", "I can't even talk about it.", "I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.", "It's a miracle. She loves him.", "No no no no no! She'll wake up!", "Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?", "Absolutely! [starts out]", "Do it!", "Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.", "What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!", "Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!", "No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.", "The reverse cycling ends tonight!

I have been so authorized.", "Okay.", "You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-", "Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?", "Lord of the Ring stuff?

It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.", "What do you want to say, Michael?", "Really?! Who?!", "Did you prank Dwight?", "Well, you like that.", "I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.", "Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.", "Ryan, just tell us your plan.", "Oh, God!", "I move we sell!", "Sell.", "Hi, Michael.", "Oh, we don't recycle.", "I'm sure no one asked you to do that.", "Listen, I know you really like Ryan--", "Michael, I... [sits down] I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?", "Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.", "And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.", "Don't.", "Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.", "Okay. Go Ahead.", "Do you mind?", "You don't have to do that.", "Are you okay, what's wrong?", "Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...", "Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.", "I'm not going to do that.", "Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.", "Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.", "Sure.", "[hangs up phone] Dwight.

Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.", "They're not of Cece.", "This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.", "Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.", "Koreans.", "White.", "Parley?", "So everyone here knows pirate code?", "You've been watering down the soap?", "We need everything back the way it was.", "That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]", "I know, because you're the reason we're moving.", "Uhh, I think it's something like umm...", "Umm, let me see.", "Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.", "Mmhmm.", "I lied about some aspects of the building.", "There's no building... it doesn't exist.", "I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet.

I don't want to fail... again.", "And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.", "Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?", "What?", "Well thanks.", "Hello, hello. You're breaking the law.", "Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.", "Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.", "Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.", "Okay.", "I'm freezing.", "I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.", "It hardly looks fake. It's so lush.", "Great.", "Nope.", "Nashua got mp3 players.", "Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...", "A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.", "Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.", "Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.", "I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.", "Hey.", "Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.", "Okay.", "I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.", "No, it has the little...", "Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?", "Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.", "Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.", "Yeah. He works here. We all know him.", "Cool.", "Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.", "Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.", "Hey, how about this one?", "Maybe. I mean...", "Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.", "Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.", "No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.", "Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.", "You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.", "Hey guys, the tree's here.", "Who told you that?", "Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?", "You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.", "Wow, an ultimatum.", "It doesn't really seem like you.", "So, cool right?", "Okay.", "Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?", "I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...", "No.", "Yup.", "No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.", "Look at this.", "Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?", "Oh, my goodness.", "Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?", "Thank you.", "[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.", "Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it]", "[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.", "I love it.", "Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.", "Michael, wait!", "That's good advice.", "That's a sad story.", "Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.", "I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.", "Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?", "So just be patient.", "Hey, sorry. I'm ready.", "Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]", "I'm sorry. I had no idea.", "Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.", "What?", "What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!", "Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.", "It's gonna be fun.", "I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome.", "Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is New Year's resolution board.", "Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards.", "Why not?", "Learn to cook for one!", "Well, maybe you'll meet someone.", "Angela.", "Make time for romance!", "I don't think so.", "No.", "I'm not... I'm not going to have...", "No! Just talk to her.", "There's a plan.", "The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.", "Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee]", "Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?", "How is it going?", "One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.", "Yeah.", "But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?", "Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.", "Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.", "You don't have to do that, Kevin.", "Oh, Michael.", "Okay, Michael, just settle down.", "Kevin, don't! Come on!", "Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.", "Okay, that's it.", "[throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.", "What's going on? Do you know that guy?", "\"Jelp?\" J-e-l-p?", "I don't think that's a word.", "You want some help?", "Mm-hmm.", "K-a. \"Ka\"? What does \"ka\" mean?", "No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?", "I think there's better...", "You could have just told us what you were thinking.", "There's no yelling in that, either.", "Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.", "I don't know. They're still in there.", "Stop. Out with it.", "Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.", "And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.", "And Tom...", "And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.", "Right. But how'd you say it?", "Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?", "Bye.", "Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny \"Jim\" game.", "All right, what'd you do?", "Where'd you put it?", "Say it. Where?", "The fridge.", "The fridge, got it.", "Bye.", "This is Pam.", "What's wrong?", "Jim, what?", "Oh God! What?!", "Ok. She's ok?", "Understood.", "Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a \"Ask Pam Beasley\". ... Did the phone cut off?", "Alright, just call me after the doctor.", "Bye.", "Yeah.", "Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.", "Well the first one has a surprise factor. \"I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!\"", "But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.", "You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.", "Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.", "[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.", "Oh, hey Dwight.", "No, he hasn't.", "No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...", "Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...", "Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]", "Ta-da!", "Yeah?", "Seriously?", "Oh! Ok.", "Guess not.", "Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.", "Hey. How you doing?", "Yeah.", "At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.", "It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.", "I'm so sorry.", "How much did you give him?", "Wait. I don't have my scarf.", "I'm missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh]", "[loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful!", "Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?", "Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?", "Yeah. What? Us?", "Yeah!", "Yeah!", "That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have s*x in the office. That's where you work, right?", "You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had s*x there, except for you and him.", "Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.", "No, we weren't.", "No.", "That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.", "Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have s*x in the office.", "Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.", "No.", "We took a walk.", "We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.", "Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.", "We'd love to see it!", "Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?", "You have to let us go Goldenface! We have families!", "Why is your face gold?", "I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?", "Awwh, you're welcome. [they hug] My pleasure.", "I just helped someone out. It feels good.", "So you know the feeling.", "[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...", "He's seriously awful!", "United front...", "You have a computer Andy.", "Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.", "Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.", "See, this is what I'm talking about.", "Sorry Andy.", "[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!", "What? Erin is that true?", "Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.", "I'm not freaking out, Andy.", "Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?", "Switch the computers back Andy.", "Seriously.", "Now please.", "I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.", "[looking confused] You did that?", "Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-", "Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?", "Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.", "Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.", "[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.", "Andy, this is the deal we made.", "We should break this hinge maybe.", "Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!", "Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]", "Yep. Lucked out.", "Yep, super lucky.", "[hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.", "Three. [Daryl nods]", "I'm full on corrupt!", "Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?", "Oh.", "Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.", "It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.", "The signs will drive people inside.", "Oh, which one is decaf?", "[looks out window] Michael! Michael!", "Hi.. I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.", "Why do you need more gas?", "Is it a good message or a bad message?", "Are you proposing!?", "Wow.", "Yea. Yea no problem. [runs away]", "Yep.", "Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.", "This is terrible.", "You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.", "Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.", "You called the meeting I don't..", "Michael.", "We are a family.", "And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.", "So about this proposal thing...", "Michael, she's perfect for you.", "So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.", "Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?", "Holy s*** is that real?", "No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.", "No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..", "She's not gonna say no.", "You were scared?", "Congratulations!", "Well, it wasn't an affair.", "But, no, but we are a family.", "Cecelia.", "Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]", "Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!", "Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.", "Da-das.", "See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.", "What's going on?", "Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!", "Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?", "You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his \"Jim face\"]", "Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?", "What's wrong?", "Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?", "Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?", "What?", "Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]", "You didn't think to mention me huh?", "[annoyed] Why?", "Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!", "Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]", "In costumes!", "What's wrong with cupcakes?", "Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.", "We thought.", "So this is the dream team.", "[surprised] Okay.", "Should we get toppings?", "[confused] What?", "Hot fudge?", "[Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.", "So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.", "It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.", "It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.", "I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.", "[in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?", "I don't, I don't think we sh-", "[stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.", "You know what, I think we should get some other input.", "Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.", "[walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]", "[watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.", "Good morning, Deangelo.", "Okay.", "Because of the flowers.", "Dogwoods, or just the Earth.", "Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla. [looking at resume] She's got great experience. We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.", "Okay.", "Oh my God, he hates me!", "I know.", "Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?", "Oh no, do you think it was stolen?", "Oh wow, you weren't kidding.", "[imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands.", "What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?", "[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?", "Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?", "So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office?", "So, umm, is this your first office job then?", "Wow.", "Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us.", "[to Jim] Just go in. Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.", "So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.

Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.", "What?", "[laughs] Okay.", "What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.", "Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]", "Or what if...", "We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.", "What are you talking about? Yes we can.", "Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on.

Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.", "So this was all just a trick. You don't really have any business to give?", "But not to us.", "You did good, Dwight. It's okay. I mean, seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not going to sell to us.", "What?", "Yeah.", "Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?", "Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.", "And it is so cute how she signs her name.", "Oh, okay.

Did you miss your bus?", "What?", "Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.", "Great. Everything's great.

[Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?", "I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.", "Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly.", "Stop that!", "Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.", "No! How? I'm so clean!", "Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.", "Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.", "Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.", "Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?", "Oh stop! I am so sorry!", "Nothing.", "I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.", "She's right, it works. I would imagine.", "Oh! Uh, uh I'll go.", "No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?", "Okay.", "Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.", "He's really making you work for it, huh?", "Great. I am killing it over here.

When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?", "Ha ha. That'd be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get... What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn't I think of this? Andy's not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I'm expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?", "A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything's in order.", "[giggles] Okay, see you later.", "You ready for your interview?", "Well, you shouldn't be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.", "Really, you can't be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he's basically Gumby with hair.

I had no idea \u2013 on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.", "Sure, no problem.", "That's sweet that he talks about me.", "Well, that's funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.", "They're the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It's like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don't blame Cece.", "Say they don't hire you. It's not like you're out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.", "Right? Thank you! It's just Philly. Everyone's acting like it's New York or Paris or London.", "Not us.", "Congratulations.", "I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.", "No, I'm not upset. I'm really excited for Darryl...

Are you excited?", "Let's call him.", "Hey, Hon, are you close?", "What?", "Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren't gonna make it.", "Of course.", "Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.", "I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we're getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, \"Bye, Daddy.\"", "Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.", "[whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural?

Kids are dancing.", "[on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance.

What?", "[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.", "Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.", "Well, it was an important phone call.", "I haven't told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he's always like, \"Beesly!\" I love that.

I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.", "No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.", "Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.", "Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?", "I don't know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.", "You know what? I-- I-- I don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --", "I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay?

Thank you.", "When are you talking to David Wallace?", "Too late. My hopes are up.", "[sighs] It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.", "Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?", "Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away.

They painted all over it.", "Yeah, but this is different.", "I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...", "Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.", "Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.", "What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.", "Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.", "[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.", "You will?", "Thank you.", "Yeah?", "Great.", "I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.", "We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.", "See, I feel bad about that.", "[interrupting] Tell us who defaced the mural!", "All right. You can go. Give him his gum.", "[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you.

Your turn.", "Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.", "What was that?", "Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?", "That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.", "We should just take him down.", "I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.", "Yes!", "Yes!", "We need an infiltrator.", "Clark?", "Shh, shh.", "Shh. Remember your lines.", "[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?", "OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...", "Yeah, something like that.", "Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck!", "OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?", "Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]", "I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?", "Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.", "Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.", "Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.", "Yeah. I feel better.", "I know. You miss Angela, don't you?", "I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose.

Supposedly.", "Yeah.", "Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.", "Where's Alyssa?", "Oh.", "[obviously flustered] Yeah.", "OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?", "I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was.

I appreciate that you appreciate that.", "So, we had couple's therapy.", "And we have homework.", "And we're also supposed to speak our truths.", "Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.", "Hey!", "Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.", "Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.", "Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.", "I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.", "Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]", "Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation.

I'm working on something.", "[pause] I'm sorry. Is there a question?", "Oh, um, well, you know, I... I just... I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.", "Listen, um... I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn't want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he's shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale. It's like a long book that you never want to end.

I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything.

Maybe.", "I'm doing it for us.", "Hold on a second.

So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper...,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I've painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead!

Oh, um, I just...I kind of meant just everybody from the office.", "Okay.", "[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I'm sorry. Jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore.", "I didn't watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It's just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm really happy now.

Okay, where were we?", "Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?", "Yep, he's lying.", "I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying.

I'm telling the truth.", "Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.", "Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-", "Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?", "Not by a long shot!", "No, it was not!", "No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?", "Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!", "Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.", "Excuse me, I got a question for you.", "Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?", "Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?", "[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren't going to look back.", "Really?", "Well. Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.", "YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on.", "Hallowed ground.", "I've seen enough.", "[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.", "Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing?

I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?", "Your path from obesity begins right here!", "Obese people in my office are a drain on resources.

And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?", "Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?", "Wait, wait.

It's really happening.", "Your clients. They're all mine.", "All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are.

What does this mean?", "No, sit down. \"Seasonal.\" Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point.

Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.", "Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?", "Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.", "Amazing.

Not so fast.", "I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.", "I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.", "Pretty good.", "[laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate.

I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.", "Yeah.", "You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He's gonna be moving slowly. It's only\u2014", "It's 15 feet down, it's at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it's like your catching a medicine\u2014", "Okay. Good call.

That's no good.", "Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic.", "You're telling me!", "What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato?

No, really.", "We'd been fighting for a while-", "He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it. But he also knew that I did.

[Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.", "Let's go.", "Michael.", "I am returning your many calls.", "No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.

Very good.", "That sounds serious, Michael.", "I can't, I can't-", "Please sit down.", "You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.", "Please, sit yourself down.", "What, Michael.", "Because nothing did, Michael. It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same", "No, Dwight; come in.", "Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?", "That's a serious offense!", "Oh! Michael, for God sakes!", "No.", "Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do[/b]: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.", "[Dwight opens door] Thank you, Dwight.", "Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?", "I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.", "'K?", "Michael, now is not the time or the place.", "No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.", "Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'", "Michael, it has nothing-", "With your looks, ok? It's your personality. I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.", "Really. You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?", "And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-", "At this time in my life. I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?", "Ohhh, God.", "So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.", "Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...", "Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.", "What are you doing?", "Michael.", "Michael.", "You are not allowed in this session.", "Now you're really not allowed in this session.", "I'm your boss.", "We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.", "Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.", "Yes, Pam?", "Michael!", "[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?", "I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,", "... but it's very destructive.", "Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?", "Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.", "I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?", "Please? Thank you. very much.", "Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.", "Great. Phyllis?", "No. Okay. Stop. Go on...", "That is an excellent goal.", "Great! Uh-huh?", "Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.", "Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?", "You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.", "Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.", "There are always a million reasons not to do something.", "All right. Let's talk about clothing.", "Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.", "Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...", "What? A union! What...", "I'm not...", "The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?", "You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.", "That's too bad.", "I don't want to...", "Michael! Michael! Michael!", "Michael.", "Don't say another word.", "Get yourself down stairs.", "Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...", "Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.", "Excuse me?", "I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.", "[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.", "I'm divorced.", "It was. Yes.", "I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.", "Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.", "Did you take care of the situation?", "Excuse me.", "Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.", "Josh Porter, Stamford.", "And Michael Scott, Scranton.", "Fine Michael. Thank you.", "Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.", "OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig,", "Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?", "Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?", "Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.", "NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.", "Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.", "Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?", "Surely, you cannot be serious?", "Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.", "Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.", "Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.", "Oh.", "Hello, Michael.", "I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.", "Well, today's not my birthday, so...", "...Happy birthday, Michael.", "Am I on camera?", "[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.", "Michael?", "You know that I'm very serious here.", "What?", "I thought that you were their fearless leader.", "[laughs] I think you can handle it.", "I think so, Michael...", "Goodbye, Michael.", "Michael?", "You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.", "I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.", "Incidentally, what is the charity?", "Okay, then. I will see you tonight.", "Bye-bye.", "Michael?", "Hi.", "What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?", "No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.", "Does anyone want a drink?", "Okay. [Carol stares at Michael]", "Cosmopolitan, please.", "Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...", "Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.", "Oh, me too. Me too.", "What?", "No, I...", "I didn't... I don't know...", "Smoke?", "Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.", "Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed", "Why did I hook up with Michael?", "It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?", "Good. Have you told anyone?", "Well, you should.", "Hey. I'm leaving.", "So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.", "And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.", "Nice to meet you.", "And you guys have a good time together.", "Yeah.", "[on the phone] This is Jan.", "Excuse me?", "Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...", "The person that you fired, Michael?", "Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.", "Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.", "Well, I'm glad you did it, Michael.", "And so, good job. Good job.", "Yeah. Good job.", "[talking over Michael] Yup. Yes.", "I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.", "And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.", "What?", "What do you mean?", "Michael. I need you to take this seriously.", "Michael-", "Are you hearing me?", "This is a very important-", "[sighs] I'll see you in ten minutes.", "I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.", "Period.", "Do we understand each other?", "Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.", "The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?", "Never for me always means never, ever, ever.", "What?", "What did you say, Michael?", "Did you call my ex?", "Gould, you said, Gould.", "How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.", "Okay, how dare you do that?", "Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?", "I mean...", "Hello, Michael.", "Can we come in?", "Thank you very much.", "Brenda.", "Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?", "A booze cruise? What do you mean?", "Michael, we discussed the IRS's regulations.", "Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.", "We discussed that.", "Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.", "I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.", "Brenda.", "Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...", "Good luck, Brenda.", "Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.", "No, that's all right.", "You call me if you need anything, Brenda.", "[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.", "Okay. So what is it that you wanted to talk to me about?", "I'm sorry?", "Well, it's probably just some accounting error.", "Well, it could be...", "Obviously we do need to find it quickly to ensure that it's not a criminal action.", "But... I guess that's it. So, call me when you have news. Okay?", "You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.", "That's not what it's called.", "Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.", "NO!", "No, it's not possible.", "You know, imagine... you were gay.", "Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Do you understand?", "Oh, hey!", "We all checked in?", "Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.", "Okay!", "What are you talking about?", "Step away from me, Michael.", "Great!", "What have you generated, Michael?", "What party?", "Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.", "Really?", "Well, Michael, I underestimated you.", "[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?", "Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]", "How would a movie increase productivity Michael? How on earth would it do that?", "Magically?", "No.", "[answering the phone] Hello?", "Who is this?", "You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.", "What about him?", "It's not about a surprise party is it?", "Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.", "How do you know I like that store?", "How do you know that?", "No it's not. It's officially not.", "Yeah.", "Really?", "Ok.", "What would you do differently?", "Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.", "[thinks for a second] Where is it?", "[on speakerphone with Michael] Michael.", "I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.", "No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.", "Mm-hmm.", "You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately.", "[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.", "Michael, Ed died over the weekend.", "[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael. I really do. So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?", "Well, what would you suggest?", "Of Ed?", "[scoffs] I'm not sure that's realistic.", "No, that's not---", "What the hell are you two talking about?", "You know what, Michael? I've really tried with you today...", "...and I have to get back to work.", "So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.", "Goodbye. [hangs up]", "Tell me what you did yesterday.", "Nothing?", "I don't care how your day was Michael.", "Tell me what you did yesterday.", "Hi, Pam.", "I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?", "Thanks Pam.", "Michael.", "Michael.", "Michael.", "I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.", "The board voted last night to close your branch.", "The board's.", "I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.", "A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.", "Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.", "Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael.", "It's... it's about talent.", "Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.", "Hi.", "Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?", "So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.", "Awesome.", "Wha... excuse... why not?", "Today?", "You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?", "Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...", "I'm gonna make some calls.", "So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.", "And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.", "Yeah.", "Michael.", "Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.", "[in Scranton] Where's Michael?", "[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?", "Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.", "Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.", "Back?", "Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.", "Michael!", "Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?", "Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?", "You do?", "What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.", "He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.", "[over phone] Mmhmm.", "We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.", "When did the check come?", "Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.", "Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.", "...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.", "Michael?", "Hello everyone. Hello Michael.", "I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.", "Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.", "Why am I here, Michael?", "In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?", "I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.", "This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.", "This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.", "Good, good.", "Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...", "Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.", "Oh, God.", "Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote \"Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.\"", "[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting. What is so urgent? Are you, are you okay?", "Okay.", "Uh when, when did, when last night?", "You went to a bachelor party at work?", "I'm closer to firing you.", "I'll talk to you later.", "Michael?", "Hi.", "Let's just blow this party off.", "Am I on speaker phone?", "Is anybody else in the...", "Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.", "Ok. Let's just go to a motel...", "...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.", "Still on speaker?", "Are camera's there?", "See you soon.", "I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.", "You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.", "I've never told you that I love you.", "I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.", "What's this over the \"i\"?", "Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?", "Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.", "Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?", "From the Scranton Branch.", "David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.", "We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?", "Martini please.", "You ok?", "It's nice.", "I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.", "I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.", "Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]", "Don't you know what I'm doing?", "Shut up.", "Come on.", "What?", "Just let me loosen my dress.", "Michael.", "Slam me up against the wall, right here.", "Oh, please.", "Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out.", "Not too good.", "I feel sick.", "No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.", "Please don't cry.", "It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.", "I didn't mean it. I was...", "Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.", "That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.", "Ok.", "Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!", "[sigh] Is Toby there?", "Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?", "Thank God.", "All right, well are you gonna take care of this?", "What did I tell you about \"yeppers?\"", "I told you not to say it. Do you remember that?", "Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?", "Today. All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?", "Great. Uh, and listen. Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.", "Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?", "No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep. So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.", "Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...", "...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship. You know this. Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.", "Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello. Come in. [exhales] Ah, Okay.", "That's my new assistant.", "I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?", "Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear?", "Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.", "Oh, God.", "Michael---", "Michael---", "Okay, Michael. Please, why don't we just take a break. This is really going nowhere.", "Ok, Toby, how about if you...", "Great.", "What's wrong with you?", "Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.", "No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it. Okay?", "No. But we can offer you 12.", "Michael!", "[on speakerphone] Michael, ...", "...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.", "I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.", "$300?", "You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?", "Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.", "So... we're good?", "[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.", "One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?", "OK. [voice on phone] \"It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...\"", "Oh. [door closes]", "[walks through front door] Michael.", "Uh, how are you?", "I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?", "I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.", "Okay.", "Been good.", "Good.", "Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.", "After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.", "To kinda clear my mind.", "It was. Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.", "I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.", "Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]", "So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.", "I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.", "And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...", "Thanks.", "Oh, okay.", "Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?", "Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.", "Hey you!", "How was your interview?", "Yeah?", "Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.", "What?", "What's... what's the matter? What... what happened in there?", "Tell me what?", "You son of a bitch!", "You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off?", "Erratic?", "[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?", "No, I wanna know. I wanna know! Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!", "No?", "'Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.", "Yeah!", "Okay, you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. Not leaving.", "[giving a hug] Bye Hunter.", "Good luck with your band.", "Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].", "Oh, God! I mean, I just don't understand! It's just so rude, you know? I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy!", "Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know? It's fine, actually, I do. I really think it's great that it happened. Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]", "[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know. It's just... I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Ohhh! They make my moods totally unpredictable! Wow! What am I gonna do?", "Live together. Actually, wait a minute! This could be great! This could be perfect! You know, my full-time job could be our relationship. I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work. This could work, really!", "[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?", "[under breath] Heaven help us. [aloud] Specifically.", "Specifically, Michael.", "[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?", "Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.", "[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.", "A quick drink?", "[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]", "Hey, Jim?", "How's work going?", "[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]", "[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.", "Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.", "Yes, they know, Michael.", "I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.", "Good.", "What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.", "Zoning out?", "If you can account for your time...", "...then maybe corporate can justify your salary.", "Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?", "What is Diwali?", "Yes.", "Mich---", "Oh.", "Oh.", "Yes, of course, I know Kelly.", "I thought she was Muslim.", "Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.", "Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---", "---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.", "Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---", "Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister.", "Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and...", "I am attracted to weird, wrong men. I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman. Life has been complicated. I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family. I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having s*x with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation. Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.", "So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?", "Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?", "Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?", "Wait, wait, what cartoons?", "[Sigh]", "Right uh, Michael.", "OK, name please.", "You're over 75 years old?", "There's no prize money.", "So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.", "I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.", "Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?", "Michael that's irrational.", "Hi, Pam.", "Is Michael in?", "[to Ryan] Hey.", "Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.", "Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.", "Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.", "Thank you, thank you.", "Best decision I ever made.", "You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]", "Hey.", "What?", "So, what's Ryan doing here?", "He's such a snake.", "I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.", "Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.", "Yes, Michael, they do.", "[on phone] My friends? Michael, I was terminated.", "Is it really that important to you?", "Alright.", "Go by yourself.", "Well...", "What? No Michael!", "You do.", "Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.", "A futon's not a sofa.", "I know what a futon is, Michael.", "It costs what it costs.", "We have gone through this.", "Conniving little runt. Put him through.", "So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.", "Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?", "You drive, I had too much wine.", "I didn't go.", "I just didn't!", "How was improv?", "[on phone] You're broke?", "[on phone] Michael, how did this happen? Where did all your money go? I don't, I don't get this. I really don't. I don't know how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say.", "[on phone] Yeah, what?", "[on phone] Okay, where did he go?", "[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?", "[on phone] I'll be right there.", "Alright. [throws her keys at Oscar]", "Michael.", "What's going on?", "Well, why are you sitting on a train? Where are you going?", "What does that mean?", "Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything. You know that.", "Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.", "Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this. It's not that bad.", "Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.", "Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me. By my side. Without even a thought. That's just who you are. I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So, where's this train taking us?", "I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.", "It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.", "[laughing]", "I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.", "Good.", "And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.", "Um, no, I want it up. My hair.", "Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.", "Does this work for you?", "Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky.", "Four million.", "No, Michael. Oh, come on.", "Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.", "Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.", "All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.", "Michael, just relax, okay?", "People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.", "Can we just move on to another question?", "Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?", "Uh, yes.", "I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.", "You keep it under my side of the mattress.", "Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.", "I love you too.", "[looks at Lester]", "Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.", "Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.", "How about Chinese?", "That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.", "Fine, fast food's fine.", "Hi.", "How are you?", "Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?", "Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.", "So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?", "Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?", "Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.", "Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.", "This is my office.", "Not super exciting.", "And this is my workspace.", "I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.", "Uh-huh, Bonfire.", "Men love this one.", "When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.", "Just like that.", "So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.", "[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.", "Shame on you.", "See, he fits perfectly.", "It's pine.", "Really?", "I bet you are.", "It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said \"Honey keep the trophies.\"", "[doorbell] Oh, excuse us just a second.", "[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.", "Oh, how thoughtful.", "Aw.", "How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?", "Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.", "You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.", "Do you have a preference, upstairs first?", "Follow me.", "So music, should we turn some music?", "Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.", "Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.", "Joe Camel!", "Oh!", "Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?", "No.", "I was watching Jim.", "No smiling.", "No no no, no names, no names, no rhyming, no soundalikes.", "No rhyming!", "[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here. The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?", "Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!", "You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.", "I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.", "[checking the oven] Uh, not even close.", "You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.", "Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.", "Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.", "Mmhmm.", "Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]", "What are you doing here?", "What is he doing here?", "Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.", "We saw Wicked.", "I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay? But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.", "I hate my life.", "[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]", "[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.", "Oops.", "Hey babe?", "How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.", "Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]", "At least he's an artist.", "[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!", "FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!", "YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!", "AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!", "[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?", "Bye Babe!", "Well it was good to see you.", "Yeah, so...", "Hello... Michael.", "I...", "No.", "Uh, no.", "I didn't...", "... touch that.", "Why?", "Yeah, it did...", "... happen when...", "... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.", "...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you. I did not.", "Yeah.", "I went to a sperm bank.", "Yuh-huh.", "Uh, yeah.", "I know.", "No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.", "IHop.", "If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.", "Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.", "Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...", "Okay.", "[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?", "I just think that...", "Why?", "I think you can. I... what?", "All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know? I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.", "Well... well, we will.", "We just will.", "I have some ideas.", "[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.", "Oh, yes, you will.", "Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition. It's not going to be in front of a judge. And it's four million dollars.", "Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.", "A little amuse-bouche, anyone?", "Okay, trivia! Does anyone know what that means?", "Oh!", "[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?", "[coming up suddenly] Are you eating?", "Really, Pam. This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]", "So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me. And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me. You know, \"Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.\" [laughs] Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?\"", "Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.", "I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.", "Yeah.", "Yeah. But, you know, it was my fault.", "Mm-hmm.", "Yeah.", "It was me!", "I spray-painted that dog. It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps] It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.", "What are you doing to him? What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?", "Please, please. Don't hurt him, okay?", "I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.", "Hi.", "Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing? Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?", "Oh, they found her?", "That's his ex.", "Hi, Jim!", "This is my baby.", "Astrid.", "Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-", "And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...", "OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...", "I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.", "Yes, yes you can.

Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.", "Jim, I am so f[bleep]ed.", "I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.", "When I was growing up, my mom said, \"the sky's the limit.\" I could do anything. Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer. But now, I, I'm not so sure.", "And if the food stations are here and here... no! Here and here. Drinks here, then people can mingle. But then where would the band go?", "Mmm, no Bob, I don't know.", "It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now. She'd show me what to do. That's stupid; she's not here. [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.", "Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.", "Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.", "It's going well.", "We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.", "Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.", "You said fruit, Michael.", "Cake.", "Yes you were.", "Split the commission?", "[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!", "There was no client. Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car. I had to walk home with no money and no phone.", "You left me in a bad part of town!", "[into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.", "Why should I have to thank him?", "I like her purple dress.", "I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.", "I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.", "Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.", "I don't care what she's doing. I just hope she keeps doing it.", "No.", "That can't be right.", "Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower.", "I know, Kevin.", "Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby. Sheet cake.", "I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee. I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.", "Sorry.", "[sigh] What are you making?", "You're making a knife with a knife?", "You want to talk about it?", "You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.", "Hi.", "It's nice to learn new things.", "Okay.", "What don't you get?", "Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.", "No, it's lettuce.", "Where are we going?", "Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.", "It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.", "I think it's a fun idea.", "We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.", "Move on, Michael.", "It's the only gavel I could find.", "Oh dear.", "Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?", "Now you move on.", "Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.", "Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.", "I have my hug.", "[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?", "Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]", "Sure.", "I'm sitting right here Dwight.", "On more week. [chuckles]", "Dwight, stop it.", "Jim, don't listen to Andy. I think it's so romantic.", "Where's your place?", "Ohhh...", "Hello.", "Know what?", "I'm sorry. It's the largest one I have.", "This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee. The theme is \"Nights in Morocco\". This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party. Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.", "Yes.", "Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.", "Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay. Everything else goes in the drawer.", "I need you to get rid of the tree.", "Thank you.", "Oh, I don't think it's blackmail. Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight. I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.", "It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone. Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.", "And napkins... fanned.", "I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.", "Oh, sorry, it's your job.", "You never showed me mercy when you were in charge. Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?", "Ok... nice.", "That's a halwa shabkia cookie. They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]", "I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.", "I didn't ask you where it was. I told you where it needs to be.", "Excuse me?", "Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having s*x with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.", "Wow, thirteen!", "Why isn't Dwight turning around?", "Andy's running over Dwight with his car.", "Dwight, get out of here!", "You've got no taste Stanley Hudson.", "Hillary Swank.", "She's not hot.", "What--", "Oh! I forgot my purse.", "What in the name of God is going on?!", "That's not a good idea, Michael.", "He needs to rest.", "We bury him?", "It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.", "Let me get you some water.", "Hey, this is your apology letter.", "I hope he's ok, I feel bad.", "Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]", "You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.", "She's out of your league Andy.", "Sexually?", "There's always a theme.", "Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me? We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.", "It is so nice to go out with another couple.", "I know", "He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.", "Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.", "Come on, Bob. Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]", "Yes I do.", "[out of breath] Bowling.", "Oh sure, a little piece. Ooh, no mushroom though.", "Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]", "Damn.", "Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.", "It's just me here.", "I think he left.", "Um, let's see... it's fine.", "Andy He's gone.", "You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.", "I never see him drink. I never see him eat.", "[muffled] No, I swallowed a crown.", "It's really cute.", "What's wrong with you?", "I think you look nice.", "You sound worried.", "Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.", "Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]", "Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.", "You mean the clients you stole from us.", "It sure looked good on the mannequin.", "Well, thanks. I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.", "Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them? That I didn't have enough time for them?", "Close your mouth, sweetie. You look like a trout.", "You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary. [sighs] No offense, Jim. I think she's very pretty.", "Those sound too harsh.", "A restaurant.", "Ryan, hand the phone over.", "Me.", "Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt. You should be apologizing to us.", "Michael, you always said we were a family. Then you went after us.", "Michael, just give us our clients back. That's all we care about.", "Michael, we have a lot of work to do.", "Work.", "It's a combo dance house coffee bar.", "Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?", "Oh, I'll just duck my head in.", "Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.", "Mmm-hmm.", "Hi.", "Hey. I like.", "Oh! Mother ******!", "Back!", "[moans in pain]", "Wow! Sorry!", "It's my back.", "Call a doctor.", "No. Call Bob.", "What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.", "Dwight! Dwight!", "I do.", "That feels good, Dwight.", "An hour? I can't stay here an hour.", "But the rattler's so scary.", "I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]", "When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]", "Wanna dance, Dwight?", "We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.", "Oh, Lord in heaven.", "Ow, my ankle!", "I... twisted it.", "During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump. We hit something with our jeep. It was probably a man. We didn't know what to do. We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could. We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home. Maybe it was just an ostrich. In a soccer uniform.", "Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.", "One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.", "Okay.", "I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.", "[to Stanley] Hey, I did good too!", "[laughing] It's good!", "We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]", "Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.", "I was all-county my junior and senior years.", "The girls school?", "They're not getting married. It's just talk.", "There's nothing to know, it's just gossip.", "Teri's out of town, Michael.", "Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.", "How far along is Pam?", "We have a right to know.", "Congratulations!", "Again with the cousin.", "What's happening to you Michael?", "What's going on?", "Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?", "Perfect. I hate registries.", "My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?", "Good. Good.", "This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!", "Not according to the beans.", "It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!", "Yeah, I would, too.", "I say no.", "Michael!", "Come on! This isn't fair!", "[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!", "Now this is getting ridiculous.", "That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]", "I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife.", "So he won't get caught!", "Disgusting...", "Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.", "Wow. Sounds scary.", "Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?", "And when you fell in, did you flounder?", "Michael, you make fun of us every day.", "So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?", "Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?", "We're not mocking, we're watching.", "Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.", "Yes. Put the DVD in.", "This is really nice Dwight, thanks.", "Holy crap.", "\"It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.\"", "You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK? [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.", "What does that mean?", "Michael, I was doing so well.", "Well, I guess that's not-", "Lose the twirl.", "Yeah, good. Don't do it.", "Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.", "Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.", "It's not like you can fire people or anything.", "Ryan.", "Sorry. Plastered.", "What's \"Scott's Tots?\"", "Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.", "That's fair.", "How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?", "Ooh.", "You didn't decorate it?", "Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!", "Yeah!", "I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!", "It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!", "Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!", "Yeah.", "Well?", "The only Santa.", "You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!", "Never mind, I shouldn't have said that.", "How do you know it's a gun?", "In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]", "All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.", "This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!", "Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -", "And this brings us to you, little one.", "It's a secret.", "Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. 'kay.", "What?", "An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.", "No Bob, we worked it out.", "I'm sorry,", "I'm really sorry. It was earlier today.", "Hi sweetie.", "I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]", "Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.", "I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.", "No.", "I did.", "You don't even like us as friends?", "I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.", "No, it's 4:35.", "Good luck!", "This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here.", "But you don't know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour.", "I have an ice cream cake in the car.", "Hey!", "But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?", "Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.", "Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.", "What are you -", "What the hell do you think you're doing?", "Are you gonna give me the leads or not?", "What are these for?", "Michael, why would we all go to the dump?", "I think you're remembering that wrong?", "I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.", "What's the least we can do to make this okay?", "I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.", "Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.", "Okay, fine. Cash it is.", "So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -", "Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So... [Jim gestures for her to continue]", "Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.", "Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.", "Say \"Me eat cookie.\"", "Mm-hmm.", "I don't get it.", "You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.", "She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.", "Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.", "Oh, Michael.", "I don't think he'd do that.", "Oh Michael.", "Hey!", "Was there a fistfight?", "And it didn't change your mind.", "Michael, that's awful.", "Yes.", "For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]", "Awww, it's kissing its mommy!", "[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.", "Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.", "I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...", "[points to the ceiling] You deserve it.", "Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]", "Luke? Luke!", "Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.", "Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.", "Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.", "Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.", "Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.", "The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?", "I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.", "Go get 'em Dwight.", "It's nice, like Up.", "Found him!", "Your show was really great, Andy.", "Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.", "Yeah, I got stung up my dress.", "[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!", "That's no pimple Michael.", "Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.", "The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.", "What? Is Dan okay?", "Yes.", "Oh, that's great news for your friend.", "You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.", "I could try to seduce him.", "Uh...", "This is weird.", "It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.", "I don't know, they're both handsome.", "I think he-", "Oh.", "What should we ask?", "An asset!", "[chuckling] Who takes a kid to Mexico?", "Church isn't a party, Michael.", "Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?", "Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?", "Here's her carrier, but no Cece.", "[to Kelly] Who's that?", "Who's that?", "Which one's Glee?", "You know your perfumes!", "Are you alright?", "I know. I thought you two were nice together.", "Made love? I don't know.", "I'll see what I can find out.", "Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?", "And I imagine things are starting to heat up?", "Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.", "Magical...", "You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.", "What do we do? How do we stop this?", "Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.", "Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.", "I am jumping.", "Yes, I'm jumping.", "Yeah, I don't even have a laptop.", "Oh God.", "Oh, don't be such a baby.", "What's the case, Toby?", "So is it an open relationship?", "Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.", "So you went homemade this year.", "Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.", "Are you good at homemade?", "Yeah...", "Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.", "I think it's good.", "I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?", "I'll talk to her, Michael.", "Why wouldn't she?", "[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?", "Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.", "No.", "So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?", "You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?", "A lot of mines in Scranton.", "I'm out too.", "Hmm?", "Wow.", "C.C", "[whispers] I'm clicking!", "I am clicking.", "Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?", "Yes.", "Yeah, who wrote it?", "Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.", "No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.", "Yeah, there you go. [laughter]", "Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.", "Mm-hmm.", "Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.", "If you're just handing them out, I want one too.", "Yeah mostly.", "It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.", "Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.", "Yeah, real cool. Real power move.", "Mmm, whatcha got?", "I love their breadsticks!", "I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.", "[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?", "The three of us have all been chairmen before.", "Yeah that was a surprise...", "Please Michael.", "I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.", "[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.", "It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.", "It's cute. [plays with it]", "What does that even mean?", "[to Dwight] Do you believe that?!", "Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]", "As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.", "Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.", "[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?", "No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!", "Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]", "They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-", "Oh no, they're still not done.", "[raises hand] Here.", "Yeah.", "Okay.", "I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.", "That's true.", "He means the ice pack.", "You could put your cell phone in it instead.", "How's your hearing?", "Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.", "[also to Darryl] Good morning.", "Did you have a nice drive in?", "Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]", "It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.", "But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.", "Mm.", "Yeah.", "Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.", "Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?", "Bestiality. Yeah.", "If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]", "I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.", "I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.", "You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.", "Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?", "He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.", "Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]", "No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]", "It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?", "Then what was this all about?", "Yeah, it can't be nothing.", "Ahhh! [falls out of chair]", "Yeah. Yeah. Oh.", "Thanks guys.", "C'mon, just say you saw the list by accident.", "Yeah, that's all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?", "Completely.", "Well, what about the other guys.", "Whew, well. I guess that's that.", "Good night, Andy.", "Ooh, why is it shaped like that?", "Andy, don't make us sell this stupid thing.", "Wait....they're terrified?", "Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can't just press a magic button.", "You don't have to thank us for coming in, it's our job.", "Phyllis:[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen's bananas.", "What else you got?", "That's still a lot of money!", "Yeah.", "What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.", "Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.", "No..we don't", "Yeah, I lost my client.", "Yeah, what's the reason?", "Yeah, it's just a picnic.", "Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?", "Who?", "Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.", "Wait, they have food there?", "I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.", "Is she Asian?", "Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?", "Hmm.", "Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.", "We did our best.", "Yeah you have this sexy glow.", "No we're not.", "Or should I have corndogs. I mean-", "Well, this could be fun. I-", "I'm in too.", "Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?", "Yeah, sign says \"Begin tour here.\"", "I don't think I should walk anymore. You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast. Two poached eggs. And then half a sandwich on the bus.", "We have a gym at home. It's called the bedroom.", "[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?", "Is that ladle stainless or...", "One, two three! [group takes shots]", "You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.", "Is that Cici?", "That's awful.", "Dwight?", "He should pay.", "What?", "Backups. [Jim goes to join the backups]", "Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.", "Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?", "Oh, I don't think you're being silly.", "[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.", "How was jury duty?", "Did you send him to the slammer?", "Oh, I'd love to but, um-", "Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.", "Yeah.", "Why?", "[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?", "Cookies?", "Oh.", "No, just go home.", "Just go.", "Are you glad to be back?", "I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....", "Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.", "If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.", "Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.", "No way.", "Do you have a black eye?", "Look, I don't feel safe. I think we should call the police.", "If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?", "[laughs] Yeah.", "Oh. [looks away]", "Make them kiss each other.", "[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?", "[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.", "Yeah.", "Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.", "Pam.", "Really?", "Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.", "Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.", "He does have a moustache.", "I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.", "It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.", "On purpose.", "Order carrot cake. [laughter]", "Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.", "Welcome to your party.", "Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.", "Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.", "Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?", "Oh, the plants are gonna love this.", "I actually sleep better when it's raining.", "What do you mean?", "Lots of things are cozy in the rain.", "I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today. I'm really happy being here.", "If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.", "Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]", "How do you?

We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.", "No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.", "Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.", "I shredded it.", "Gosh, I just don't know.

Go.", "Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states. Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo. Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.

I have a fiance I very much like!", "It doesn't matter, Michael.", "Listen, dummy! It's not that hard.

No.", "[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.", "[Dwight slaps her butt] Hey!", "I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows.

I am.", "Come on!", "Oscar.", "I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.", "We need to know more. Did their shots have sound?

[Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]", "[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.", "I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.", "No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.", "Two sacks' worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.", "It's the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She's this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.", "And they're gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.", "I guess.", "Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training.

No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn't want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do.

The city is... amazing.", "No. You don't know until you live there. There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.", "No. You can't imagine it, though.

But guess what, now I want to see love actually again, [Phyllis throws her money down] but it's at the bottom of the que! Oh no, what do I do!? [Creed throws his money down] What I do, is this. I go online, I go click, click, click. And I change the order of the que, so that I can see Love Actually [Pam throws her money down] as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan.

Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now.

Here's what I'm going to do-", "We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great.

We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured. Jim, can you come in with us please?", "Hmm.", "I find that extraordinarily surprising.", "We'll bring them both in.", "Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.", "Yeah, yeah.", "I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.", "Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.

Your company is four weeks old. I know this business. I know what suppliers are charging. I know you can't be making very much money. I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way. I'm sure you're scared. Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.", "Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000. Hmm? $60,0000. Michael?", "Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside. Take your time.", "So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer. We can finally put this whole thing behind us?

What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, \"oh, this would be really funny.\"", "Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence.

I think you're great.", "Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?", "I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.", "Can you do it?", "So no?", "What do I put you down for, bro hombre?", "All right!", "Okay, than you so much.

I'm a nice guy.", "Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this.

I want you to be my enforcer.\" Smart, right?", "Uh, this has got to stop.", "Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?", "Hey, Robert.

Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.", "What's up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.", "And it was open. And people saw this. And they're just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.", "It's a photocopy from your notebook.", "No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.", "What?", "That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?", "Okay. Robert's in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?", "Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?", "Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.", "Dwight!", "Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!", "Great group! Pizza party!", "Well, why don't you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.", "Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?", "Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.", "Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.", "C'mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?", "Yeah?", "When I was a salesman I could just be like \"Not my job, not my prob. I'm going to the warehouse to polish my knob.\" Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.", "Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it's really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let's say top-tier and others would be second-tier.", "Thank you. Great. Robert.

Stanley... you may think he's a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he's hard to love, but did you know that he's in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?", "Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word \"no\" not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call.

Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business...see how things are going? Ahem...", "If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert...man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how's the sales doubling ...project going?", "OF course not. There's no magic button. You have to summon that.", "Dwight, anything?", "You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.", "Fart..... good Sesh. [gets up] That leg's asleep.", "D-Bone. There you are.", "No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about...", "I know, right?", "Yeah...um, how is everything?", "Must be a tough time to be a family farm.", "Oof.

[shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?", "You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...", "Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.", "We need you, OK?", "OK?", "Alright.", "Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.", "Good. Keepin' 'em honest.", "Are we scaring them straight....?", "Is everyone licensed?", "No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.", "No. Not joking.

Um...", "No. Because they all left.", "I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn't help.", "What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.", ".....OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.", "So Darryl says to me \"fire me\". But what he really means is \"I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.\" So I say \"No, you're not fired.\" But what I really mean is \"I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.\"........I really hope that's what he and I mean.", "Attention!

Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?", "So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.", "Surprise! Your new crew.", "Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?", "Yeah.", "Haha, what?", "I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.", "Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?", "He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?", "None, no part of this has anything to do with you.", "Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.", "Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]", "OK what?", "Ah, OK.", "Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK.

Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.", "Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back.

So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to \"play ball.\" Those were his words.", "So make that error!", "Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.", "It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?", "Oh.", "What?", "You know what? Go. Have fun.", "There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.", "I didn't even say what it is.", "But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...", "Yeah? You like it?", "All right.", "I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, \"this sounds really stupid.\"", "There is one problem with this plan.", "We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.", "You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.", "I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.", "Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?", "It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar's friend walks up] Not anything.", "Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.", "A-team.", "All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]", "Oh, we got this!", "Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.", "You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.", "So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.", "[dances] Whoo! Yeah!", "Go Einsteins!", "Oh, come on!", "Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.", "My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...", "Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.", "Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.", "Oh.", "[hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.", "Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]", "No, I'm good.", "Hi.", "It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.", "Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.", "No. What?", "All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.", "Okay.", "In a minute. In a minute.", "A minute would be cool.", "Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?", "Where... [finds pants, looks for ring]", "No thanks.", "Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.", "I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?", "The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?", "You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.", "Yeah!", "Yeah!", "Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa!", "I cannot believe you're still up!", "[muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-", "Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.", "Mmm.", "Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.", "We're done. Erin and I are over.", "Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.", "[Erin swims up with ring] Wow.", "Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?", "Duh.", "Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.", "Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.", "Val, I need the space.", "Everybody out.", "I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.", "Obviously I'm going to clean up.", "Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, \"Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,\" and then you have to be like, \"Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!\" And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] s*x also works.", "Hey! Tuna! He's back.", "Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.", "[grabs Jim's wrist] Hand roll.", "Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?", "What's up, gangstas?", "Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.", "No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.", "Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.", "Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.", "Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]", "I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.", "No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?", "Do you know why you never heard of it?", "Covered it up.", "They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.", "My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.", "Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.", "Why? Everybody's heard it.", "Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.", "Why? Why? [looks at Jim]", "His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.", "Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.", "We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?", "I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].", "[sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.", "Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.", "Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.", "I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]", "Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.", "Oh!", "Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?", "There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.", "Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?", "Hey, we'll be just fine.", "Oh, whew!", "Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.", "Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!", "Dwight, I have exciting news for you.", "I think you're going to like it.", "Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...", "That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.", "No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.", "And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.", "Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.", "Uh yeah, look at that.", "Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.", "You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?", "Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?", "They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.", "Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.", "You have your team.", "Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs]", "Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.", "Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!", "I use the word \"guys\" a lot when I'm nervous...guys.", "Guys! Guys! Guys!", "Guys..", "Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.", "Wha-", "OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.", "No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.", "Five to six hours?", "No no no no.", "Nope.", "Thirty minutes!", "Or both?", "Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.", "Thank you.", "Thank you.", "Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?", "Well...", "Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?", "Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..", "Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.", "OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy..", "....Stanley..", "...Ryan...", "...Erin...", "...And, Jim.", "Safe travels.", "Oh, K. It's only three weeks.", "Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.", "It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler.", "Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.", "Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash.", "Oh! There we go! Pam?", "Can you get the phone?", "Mm, well, you used to be.", "Phone's ringing.", "Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?", "Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.", "Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.", "Up high.", "Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out.", "I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks.

This is Andrew.", "Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.", "I miss her too.", "[laughing] Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat.

And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!", "Heyyy... let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!", "Goat...", "Thornwood Wholesalers.", "I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.", "... yeah...", "Thank you.", "Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?", "Play it cool, man. She'll come around.", "Yeah, but... My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.", "Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee...", "I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion...", "Morning, everyone.", "Don't care. Tell me later.", "What do you got?", "Yes, I do. Phyllis.", "What?", "Here's what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam...", "They had, uh... weapons.", "I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.", "Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.", "I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done.", "No.", "No, no, no, no, no, we don't need to call the police. They'll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone's business, right, Pam?", "And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.", "Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.", "Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why... Toby is giving us self defense training.", "Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?", "Great.", "What if you're being attacked by a ... smallish man who happens to not have a groin?", "What if you're being attacked by a 4'11\" man who is penisless?", "Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.", "So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?", "[softly] Take that, kid.", "[deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.", "[deep voice] Listen, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I'll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.", "Oh... [Kelly laughing]", "Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!", "You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. \u00a0I stepped in and I didn't care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, \"Where were you when the girls came?\"", "Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. \u00a0I just feel good!", "[exiting office] Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.", "He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.", "Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.", "How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.", "I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure.

I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.", "What?", "Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.", "I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.", "Ryan, why didn't you tell me?", "You never update it.", "Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?", "I'm going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!", "[on phone] Hello.", "Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.", "Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the...", "[standing in ocean] ...Florida Flu.", "I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map.

Thanks a lot, BP.", "[singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!", "Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.", "Hm?", "Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.", "All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.", "[on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-", "Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.", "I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine.", "I don't think it does that.", "Jim?", "I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.", "What do you mean, take my job?", "Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.", "Yeah, if I had my own--", "--sorry, you go.", "Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?", "You broke my heart too.", "I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.", "[sighs]", "That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.", "Erin!", "Okay.", "Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.", "Like your toothbrush and stuff.", "You don't have a toothbrush?", "How do you not have a toothbrush?", "You just use whichever one is sitting there?", "Of course. I own my toothbrush.", "[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.", "On the road with my new girlfriend.

Hmm.", "[sings] Time to have a little kiss!", "Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.", "I believe in that.", "I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.", "Mm-hmm.", "...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.", "Consider it nailed.", "Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-", "I just need you to know-", "Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.", "Hey, Lauren. Look at you.", "I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.", "Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.", "Yep. This is Erin.", "Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-", "It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy pen1s?", "These are delicious.", "Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know. I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.", "Hey.", "Oh! Ah, Megan.", "Aww.", "Oh, he's out there.", "Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...", "[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...", "No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?", "Uh, maybe we could talk in private?", "Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.", "Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.", "Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.", "I am gay, and I prefer men.", "You did not, Kenny!", "I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.", "Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.", "Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-", "Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.", "Right? Rough scene.", "Oh... at least we can kiss now.", "You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.", "Yeah.", "Oh yeah.", "I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]", "Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there.

Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.", "I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.", "Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.", "Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.", "Get back to normalcy.", "This is what I was trying to tell you.", "[chuckling] Okay.", "You can't dock my pay-", "Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?", "Angela?", "Ooh, she's counting again.", "Oh, oh!", "Seriously, Angela?", "I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.", "You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.", "It's literally like-", "Oh, yeah, I was just tired.", "Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.", "Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.", "You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.", "Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.", "Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.", "Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?", "I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.", "Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?", "Fascinating.", "Okay, so I-", "Yeah Jim, get it out there.", "[on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level.

I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once!

I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.", "Why would that be weird?", "Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?", "Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!", "[points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things?

Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!", "You're being a Thomas Oregon!", "Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you.

I will take all of those dogs!", "No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.", "No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around.

This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--", "Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!", "Yeah, I do. I have that.", "Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!", "Morning.", "Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot... these.", "You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.", "What's this?", "Is this Robert's attempt to embarrass me?", "Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they're rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it's a little much? ...Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that's what it feels like.", "Lot going on guys. What's happening?", "That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It's like a festival of poo.", "Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.", "[Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.", "Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.", "I forgot, a... a pan, uh \u2013", "Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.", "Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.", "No, I do not.", "Seriously? \u2018Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.", "I'm a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.", "No. I'm a rogue.", "Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now... [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.", "Of course they have. Which is why I'm giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need \u2013 anytime, night or day \u2013 you just stop on by.", "Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe... you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.", "Yes, yes, yes!", "[in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don't, and I will find another buyer.", "It's just business.", "Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]", "You got a minute?", "I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.", "Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.", "[wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys.", "[whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?", "Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...", "Clean the toilets.", "Pull the poop out of the toilets.", "Just, please...", "Please!", "Give me something!", "Thank you.", "Thank you.", "I have a delicious secret.", "Yeah, it is actually.", "Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.", "This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.", "Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.", "But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh!", "A delicious moment.", "Well, but it-", "I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.", "No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.", "That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.", "[his phone rings] Huh? Hold on.", "I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!", "I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.", "Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum \"Suck It\" to the U.S. military.", "I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.", "Stop saying my name.", "Thank you, Erin.", "Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.", "Yeah, I know.", "What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?", "But it's- it is- it is me? Right?", "What?", "Oh my God!", "Wow. From janitor to manager?", "That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.", "From total loss to total boss, I mean-", "I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.", "Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.", "Gosh, I hope so.", "Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.", "It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.", "No.", "Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?", "I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?", "If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?", "All right, you sly b*st*rd. When can you start?", "Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?", "Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]", "I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated.", "Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There's no way to know if you're dead!", "When you're a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this [imitates plane noises while steering wildly] But then you learn that's crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. [calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth] Or better yet, like this. [takes hands off imaginary wheel] Now that I'm manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.", "Which combo do you think Robert's gonna like better?", "This is combo number seven.", "You're right, you're right, you're right. Uh! It's so hard to find an occasion for this clip.", "Sure.", "Thanks T-Dog.", "Tuna dog!", "I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like \"Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas\" Well I don't know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don't have any bombs.", "[sighs] Yeah.", "I don't have any ideas though.", "You do?", "Yeah....I don't think that's legal. It's a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?", "You didn't have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain]", "You're the only person who's congratulated me.", "Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?", "Awesome.", "Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d'oeuvres and the animals on Noah's ark?", "With Hors d'oeuvres we only take one at a time.", "My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it's just that maybe one's a little higher than the other?", "Let's not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.", "Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?", "Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin]", "Yeah?", "I don't think so.", "Yeah. I'm still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let's hold off on the D-man for now.", "Charge!", "It's kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.", "Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.", "Water.", "Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.", "Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil's Den. It's the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.", "Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it's not cool.", "That is what I'm showing you.", "Andy:[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don't beat it, stay where you are.", "What did you say?", "What would you say?", "That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?", "Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.", "So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.", "Ugh! He's always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?", "Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11AM. It's just...common...decency.", "It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.", "Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.", "For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.", "Oh, I see.", "Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....", "Alright, you got it.", "...and an American Express green card.", "Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.", "Well I'll do you one better.", "I got you health insurance.", "Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.", "Yes!", "Einsteins! Great work.", "You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?", "Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.", "Alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.", "Not helping, tuna.", "We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.", "No, that's why...that's why I said think of it.", "Have I mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and Robert] Took me two weeks.", "Hey.", "Yeah, it sounds like it.", "Bring it on guys.", "Let's go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool]", "Alright! Here we go.", "Hey! High-five!", "So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?", "You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-", "Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he's like to say.", "No.", "That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-", "Ho hah!....oh, shoot.", "Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!", "What're you still doing here?", "You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.", "See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It's Clark and, um\u2014", "In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.", "Cause you're always taking dumps.", "Come on, everybody defecates.

Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?", "Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]", "David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.", "Yeah, I gotta go David.

It's going to be terrible.", "No I'm going to make sure that it is. And if it isn't, I'm going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don't like to throw around the b-word, but I'm going to be a huge bitch to you.", "Now this is called slack lining.", "I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.", "If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you'll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.", "That's me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.", "All right, who's next? Nellie?", "Nonsense. Get up here.", "Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?", "Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who's next? Darryl?", "Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.", "Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.", "Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.", "Hey, yes.", "Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.", "Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?", "Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.", "There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.", "[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.", "Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.", "I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.", "[in his office] Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?", "[entering annex] Clark, you and I need to have a little chat.

I didn't feel good about that.", "I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up.

[to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you.", "It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.", "Really?", "[Begins raising sail] Up she goes!", "Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.", "You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. [begins raising sail, boat guy slaps his hand]", "You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- [Raises sail, guys slaps hand again] wow.", "Ok, fine.", "Yeah, fine.", "Good stuff. Nice stuff. [begins raising sail again when guy leaves, but he comes back and smacks Andy's hand again] [bleep] Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.", "I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.", "Fine. But I could have.", "I am the captain.", "Right?", "I'm the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.", "I'm taking it over from here.", "Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there.", "Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?", "Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello. [Opens door, Andy's brother is passed out inside] Walt?", "I thought you were in rehab.", "I didn't. I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat. But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda.", "Same thing. [To Walt] Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.", "Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you. Do you realize that? You're the best ever!", "[pulling away from dock] Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!", "[waving from boat] I'll see you in three weeks!", "No way!", "Erin I gotta go![Walt begins playing] Them's my chords!", "[on computer screen] Ah, what else? I've seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times. Breaks my heart every time, you know?", "That Swayze sure can dance dirty.", "No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes. They're like two flaming meatballs in my skull.", "[on computer] Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That's what I call the sun now.", "What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!", "Yeah, it was. That's okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out. Ow!", "Ah! That's not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily]", "[on computer] I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.", "No. No! Nooo! [computer falls into ocean]", "[in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.", "Well, well, well, look who it is.", "I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.", "Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.", "[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.", "Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes g\u00fciro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]", "Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.", "I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.", "Question. Where's Jim?", "For two hours? Really?", "If the shoe fits. [plays g\u00fciro and sings, Kevin echoes]", "I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.", "And you sold it to Jan too.", "I mean... I'm impressed.", "Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.", "I was...", "Andy:That...", "OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.", "Say it.", "Coolio.", "Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.", "Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.", "I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.", "Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.", "No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.", "It, it's, it's actually just an issue...", "Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...", "Well, ah, ah...", "Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.", "[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.", "All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?", "Wow, that's wonderful!", "Uh-huh.", "Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.", "[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What's going on in here, dirty players?

Back to work.", "I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.", "Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?", "Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.", "Thank you.", "Great!", "[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!", "What?!", "There was a fire in the warehouse?", "This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?", "What?!", "No kidding?", "Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.", "Good, good. What else?", "Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.", "The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.", "[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.", "I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.", "Thank you.", "Yeah, I guess.", "Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?", "What?", "OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.", "On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.", "I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.", "I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.", "I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.", "Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally.", "I resent that. I, I never lied to you.", "And all was good in Scranton PA that day.", "Oscar says \"hi\" all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. \"Hi\" \"Hello\" \"Hola\" You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say \"hi\"?", "But you're calling me a liar.", "By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.", "Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013.

[David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.", "Good morning.", "And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]", "[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.", "[Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh", "Where are you going?", "Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?", "I'm still the boss!", "The answer is yes.", "Are they from you?", "Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.", "Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.", "I don't want to talk about work right now.", "Then I want my big blue sweater back.", "She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?", "Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.", "Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?", "Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.", "No.", "May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]", "Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.", "I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.", "Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?", "Everyone please, just-", "Oh my god.", "Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.", "Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?", "Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?", "I knew it!", "You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!", "No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!", "Yeah. You. Are. Fired!

Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.", "Ugh.", "That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.", "What?!", "[wipes nose] Sorry.", "My whole life is a booger bubble!", "Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: pen1s. Translation? My manhood.", "Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.", "Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.", "Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.", "Hi.", "Hi, how's it going?", "Wow this sure is intense.

[leaves]", "Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.", "Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?", "Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?", "And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.", "We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?", "Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.", "Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.", "[exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking?", "Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know.

It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree. But ideally you would have selected totally agree.", "Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.", "Thank you. In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.", "Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company. Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?", "Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.", "Well, I just have to get through the binder.", "I am?", "Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil. That's not right.", "No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies. It's part of the ethics thing.", "Ok, but we should get back to business. Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.", "What was the dilemma?", "Oh--- no no no.", "No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.", "Meredith, that is serious. I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.", "Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.", "I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.", "So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?", "No, it's not a formality. Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal? Unrelated to business?", "What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons? I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?", "Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace. I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.", "It's Mike-raculous.", "Sounds good.", "Oh I already bought this...", "So, I've gone over corporate policy.", "Oh, it's very nice.", "Mmm.", "In Summer.", "Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.", "Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.", "I'm from da future.", "Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol. Those are the rules.", "We punish her?", "I don't think we could enforce that.", "A chastity belt.", "No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.", "What am I saying?", "I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.", "It's not a family. It's a workplace.", "It's been a little tense. People are suspicious of me. And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular. I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker. I was just hoping middle school was over.", "Can I sit?", "Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.", "Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.", "Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.", "No, I understand.", "No. I can do it.", "Can I have everyone's attention? Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please. We need to finish the ethics seminar.", "Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.", "In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days. Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers. Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.", "Ahoy.", "Good.", "Of course. Yeah.", "You OK? You seem kind of...", "I can imagine.", "Oh, I think she's on a sales call.", "Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed] No, she's just on a coffee break.", "She's with Angela.", "You still gonna be mean to me?", "Yes.", "Hello.", "Yeah, it was nice.", "Oh, that would be great. You need that.", "Yeah.", "Yeah.", "It would help.", "[to camera] No, he didn't.", "Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager?

[walking into the girls bathroom]", "I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?", "Oh, good.", "Can I talk to you for a second?", "That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?", "Michael I think this is our fault.", "Oh...", "How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.", "Michael scored the big ticket item. Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.", "He knows how to get things. He got me.", "[giggles] Sorry.", "Mm-hmm.", "Mm-hmm.", "The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.", "Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.", "Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.", "Breaker one-nine, copy?", "Kidding.", "It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said \"Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?\" And he said \"I asked you first.\" And I said \"First!\" at the same time he did. And then I said \"Jinx.\" And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...", "I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!", "Yeah it did look shorter on the map-", "You were sleeping? You were talking before.", "We're only halfway?", "Let's check there.", "No.", "No.", "No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please?

Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.", "If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?", "And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.", "Oh.", "Well-", "How long could we keep that up?", "Years?", "Years? Of just a few hours every weekend?", "[kisses his temple] Thank you.", "I do, I think so.", "You'll be okay", "You will.", "Okay. Bye.", "Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.", "All right.", "Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?", "Lemonade sounds great.", "Um, not much.", "I remember your chair pants idea.

So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?", "Do you have a script for the sketch, or...", "Crystal cool.", "[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.", "We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]", "Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.", "Dun-der. Dun-der...", "Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.", "Oh.", "Hmm...", "Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?", "For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?", "That is correct!

She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone.

Huh.", "Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?", "Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it.

Fascinating.", "Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.", "No, that's absolutely the case.", "Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life?

So... is there anything else you wanna say?", "Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation s*x club over on I-84. The red room say?

Why don't you list the things that would keep you from helping me.", "Let's do it now. What's number one?", "There we go.", "Where's the Advil, Jim? I think I've hit my limit on the Tylenol \u2013 Oh.", "Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?", "Oh, for god \u2013", "Harry...", "How do you mean?", "Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There's no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems... so poorly timed.", "I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said... [Andy walks out]", "Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? [camera pans to right, Harry, Dwight, and Jim watching Robert in conference room] They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I'll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.", "Hmm.", "Excellent. Excellent.

You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?", "So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.", "I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.", "Performance reviews.", "On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.", "All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.", "Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.", "Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.", "Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?", "Then you accept it?", "Absolutely not. Seven percent.", "So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.", "So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.", "Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.", "Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.", "So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.", "That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.", "Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?", "You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?", "Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.", "I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: \"I'm amazing.\"", "Jim, time for your review.", "Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?", "Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?", "I'm Tinkerbell.", "Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.", "But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.", "She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?", "I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.", "Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.", "Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.", "Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!", "Ah ha!", "Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.", "Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?", "Ugh! I hate that! No offense.", "oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!", "Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]", "If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?", "Yes, Robert!", "Yeah.", "Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.", "[walks in] Oh.", "I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.", "God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.", "I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?", "Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.", "God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?", "Jim, could you give us a hand?", "Why thank you.", "Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?", "Yes?", "Oh yes.", "You are most welcome.", "No.", "Mm-hmm.", "Hmm, no.", "No.", "Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.", "I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.", "Five... four...", "Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars.", "Do you want to go again?", "Let's go again. Five... four...", "Three... two... one...", "Angela, two hundred dollars!", "I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...", "Three...", "Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.", "What do you mean?", "I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.", "Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.", "Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.", "No.", "Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.", "\"Take a man's job, but leave him his balls.\" Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.", "This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.", "Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.", "Dwight told me about it earlier.", "Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?", "Oh... Stanley?", "Creed, you are a thousand years old.", "The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.", "Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.", "Okay, just calm down.", "It's the apology. I really have to insist.", "Stop saying no.", "I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?", "Yeah", "I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.", "[hears knocks on door.] Come in!", "Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.", "How are things in the warehouse?", "The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?", "[speechless.] I...", "Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.", "Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?", "What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!", "Brilliant!", "Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?", "$30, yes!", "I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!", "Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos!", "Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!", "I got your voicemail. From \u2013 from last night.", "And the answer... is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]", "Oh. Oh, I'll tell you what he does.", "Do you think I'd like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?", "Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?", "Oh!", "Oh, gosh.", "Thank you. I'm... so stupid.", "Oh, god, Pam. Don't get me started.", "You've just got me started. Robert... is... a filthy beast.

Perfect.", "It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.", "Wonderful, thanks.", "Brilliant.", "Not necessarily", "Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.", "I'm very self-conscious about my feet.", "Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would\u2014[hit in the face with trash]", "Oh, it's nothing to do with me.
