I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.",300,22,322,0.9178

13163,Michael,Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during s*x.,300,22,322,0.7401
13165,Michael,And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.,300,22,322,0.4404
